PREFACE	





RULES ARE MEANT TO BE BROKEN
It was the summer of 1989 when I was first exposed to Shadowrun via a four-page preview pamphlet at my local game store. A few weeks later and I had purchased the First Edition rulebook and taken the first steps on the path to what would become the greatest RPG love affair of my life. Wait, elves and cybernetics? Megacorpora- tions and dragons? You can't do that!
   I spent the next nineteen years running a cam- paign, and for most of it we were playing weekly, every Monday night. There are living, breathing stories and characters that only exist within the minds of the few people that sat around that table, and any one of them will happily regale you with tales of the duplicitous machinations of a dwarf fixer named Redeye or the tragic end of Eddie Garrett, ex-Lone Star cop turned reluctant shadowrunner.
   Shadowrun occupies a very special place in my heart. The walls and shelves of my home are covered in Shad- owrun books and art, and indeed sometimes I have to remind myself of the countless people who have fallen in love with the Shadowrun world not through the classic tabletop role playing game, but instead through one of the many Shadowrun video games, or any of the more than fifty published novels.
   But everything ends. My beloved campaign came to a satisfying conclusion in the fall of 2008, and while I have kept up with the game's new editions and releases, and flirted with some short story arcs, it hasn't returned to my table in any meaningful way for a while. I find that my tastes have changed over the years, and while I have lost no love for the Shadowrun world, these days I prefer

RPG game systems that are lighter on the rules and more focused on story and character. There has been a massive explosion of indie-style RPG game play in the last few years, and many people are engaging with the hobby in intriguing new ways. As a hobby-game retailer myself, I have also witnessed no shortage of gamers interested in playing tabletop Shadowrun but utterly intimidated by the massive rulebook. The fact of the matter is that that big black book isn't going anywhere, and there will always be players who want to joyously fiddle with ev- ery last glorious detail and chrome widget of rules found within those pages, and more power to them. I was one of them for a very long time.
   Shadowrun has been part of our collective gaming consciousness for well over twenty-five years now, and it's been actively in print the whole time, something very few games can claim. It's been so long in fact, that what was a game of a speculative future has now become what is veritably an alternate history game! (Since mag- ic did not, alas, return to the world in 2011. Although there's still a slim chance that my friend Warren might goblinize into an ork in 2018, as we've all long suspected he will, but that remains to be seen.)
   Some of us shadowrunners are now getting long in the tooth, lacking the time to play or facilitate a game with such a robust and exhaustive rules set. Meanwhile, more collaborative storytelling-style RPGs and even gamemaster-free RPGs are seeing some real popularity as the hobby continues to grow and evolve.
   That's where Shadowrun: Anarchy comes in. It's flexi- ble enough to be played as a rules-light version of a tra- ditional roleplaying game, or as a much more freeform "open table" style storytelling experience. I am incred- ibly pleased with what the Catalyst team has come up with here, and I think it has the potential to inject a

whole lot of new energy into the Shadowrun community. It's certainly going to get a new campaign to my table for the first time in years.
   So if you're new to the Sixth World, welcome. Maybe you've always wanted to be an elf street ganger with an adrenal pump and a heart of gold. Or you've always en- tertained fantasies of summoning spirits from the back alley streets of Seattle by muttering arcane mysteries through your massive ork canine teeth. Or you're dying to see your Shadowrun video-game character come to


life in a tabletop pencil-and-paper RPG. There's plenty of room for all of us in the shadows.
   If, like myself, you're returning to Mr. Johnson's table after a few previous jobs, you'll fit right in, but you'll find that the rules have changed a bit. But rules are meant to be broken.

"I don't like it," Sledge said into their huddle, casting a wary glance clean over Hardpoint's head.
   "You don't like anything," Gentry said, then stuck his tongue out. "It's barely even worth saying any more."
   "Boys." Coydog shot a glance between the two of them, quirking an eyebrow.
   "Listen here, you little squi-" Sledge started in, but got himself cut off.
   "Boys," Ms. Myth's troll-deep voice ended the argu- ment before it really got started. "We need in the building to get the focus. They need in the building, too. There's no need for two teams to be at odds with each other, is there? They're short on technical support, so we've got an advantage if things go sideways, and Sledge's worst fears come true."
   "M'not scared," the big ork mumbled to nobody in particular.
   "It just makes sense," Hardpoint cut in with dwarven certainty. He didn't speak up as often as the others, and when he did, they listened. "I say aye."
   "Aye," Gentry nodded, shooting a glance at a particu- larly leggy member of the other team.
"Aye," Coydog nodded with a bright smile.
   "Nay," Sledge crossed his blocky cyberarms over his broad chest.
Myth spoke last, like she so often did.
   "Ayes have it, not even countin' mine, sweetie. If they're in, we're in."


"I don't like 'em." Lefty shot the larger group a concerned look, glaring a bit at the decker who kept staring at her. Her chromed-up left hand flexed and straightened with tension. Her right hand-her shooting hand-didn't move.
   
"You rarely do," Alyosha teased, the good-natured dwarf shooting her a smile that took the edge off.
   "I know Myth," Tiny's bass rumbled. The troll easily doubled Alyosha's height and even loomed over the elf- lanky Lefty. "She's a righteous tusker. An' I've heard good things about her crew. They'll do fine."
   "Yeah, but what will they be fine at doing? I heard 'em say they're after some magical doohickey-"
   "A focus," Alyosha said, since he was the one who was supposed to know magic for the rest of them.
   "Doohickey," Lefty doubled down. "And this isn't a re- trieval job for us, as you two well know. We can't let 'em slow us down. In and out, maximum speed, minimum time, that was our plan."
   Alyosha sighed. Precision was great, right until the mo- ment that it interfered with actually getting the job done. "Well without 'em, I'm our only way through the front fraggin' door, Left-o, and same with every other stinkin' door we come across. That's gonna slow us plenty, right? Highball's still down, can't run off-site info-tech for us.
Without a decker, we're hosed, and they got a decker." Lefty peered over at Gentry, who smiled at her. "Some decker," she grumbled.
   "I and great Bear," Alyosha Duska gestured every- where and nowhere in particular, as he often did when talking about the spirits he could call, "Vote aye."
"Aye," Tiny's massive head shifted in a nod.
"Nay," Lefty pouted. "Fat lot of good it'll do me. Fine.
If they're in, we're in."
She glared over at Gentry who lifted a hand to wave. "But I'll be using an 'I told you so' later."


"Hey." Sledge introduced himself to the massive troll- massive even compared to Ms. Myth, who was partic-

ularly proud of her girlish figure-with open hostility and only grudging civility. The ork carried a sleek assault rifle and had a Neil the Ork Barbarian reproduction mo- no-sword over his shoulder.
   "Yo." Tiny looked down at the chromed-up ork, show- ing wry amusement. His weapons, his arms, his style, was visibly and overtly lower-tech. Sledge knew the type, runners who thought older, simple stuff was more reliable. Tiny rippled with trollish mass, and his most obvious weapon was an absurdly heavy chopping blade, a machete writ large and in bold.
   The two sized each other up, then fell into a tense silence, just waiting at the front of their pile-up for the rest of their teams to get in line. Everybody on both crews knew who'd take point. The two of them filled the alley, regardless, it would've been tough for anyone else to get past them to be in front of they'd tried.
   "<In position.>" Hardpoint's voice came through both teams' commlinks, lacking inflection as was always the case when the dwarf rigged. He'd stay in the van, but-sure enough-shortly after his announcement, a pair of low-flying hoverdrones zipped into view, stubby autorifles held aloft on whirring gyroblades.
   "Neat!" Coydog clapped her elf-thin hands as Dus- ka finished his quiet, guttural, chanting and a ripple of power flowed from him. Nobody else on either team was Awakened, nobody else had their eyes open to the astral and the tricks of power the two shamans could pull, but the elf seemed impressed with his summoning work.
   "Your turn," the dwarf said with a wry smile, only to tilt an approving eyebrow a moment later. There was, again, no obvious display of power as Coydog finished her crooning call, but a light breeze teased at her long, dark, hair, and apparently her own incantation was complete.
   "Nice. Multi-spirit support," Lefty grudgingly admitted. "Hey! Uh, you want me to take a look at your fire- wall?" Gentry sidled up, trying his friendliest smile. "I
heard your usual Matrix dude wasn't-"
   "Nope." She started screwing her oversized silencer into place on her long rifle, not even looking at him. "I'm good."
   "Oh. Yeah. Okay, raé, I feel ya." Gentry looked halfway cool for about a second. "But what about the latest patches on your smartlink software, though? I bet my download speed is pretty wiz. I've got this sweet Sony Cybe-"
   "I'm good." Her tone was chillier this time, a boxy magazine slapped home with a metallic snick-snack of finality.
   "Yeah, okay, cool I'm just gonna, uhh ..." And then he was in a hurry to be somewhere else.
   Sledge grunted in amusement. Tiny shook his shaggy head. Alyosha chuckled openly. Coydog giggled and of-




fered Lefty a long-distance fist bump. Hardpoint's metal- lic, far-off heh heh heh rang into earbuds and cyberaudio suites across both teams. Gentry's cheeks flushed red, and he was abruptly very busy with something in aug- mented reality.
   Myth split the night with a big-palmed clap and a bright smile. Lefty took off up a fire escape, long gun barely slowing her down. Gentry slunk past the moth- erly troll, who reached out to tousle his hair, easing the sting of yet another elven rejection.
   "Okay runners," she said, nodding toward the door. Lefty clambered into her sniper's nest, Hardpoint's drones whirred and climbed. Tiny and Sledge readied their weapons.
"Let's get running."


Lefty leaned and twisted to swing her scope around and watch their progress. Hardpoint's gun-drones spread to cover each flank, the shamen huddled next to Myth in the middle of the group, the street muscle-ork and troll-waited at the door, ready to commit terrible vio- lence as needed.
   Gentry handled the camera just below the glowing Wuxing logo, then the door just below the camera, then the camera just inside the door. The human might not be all that socially adept-especially around elves-but Lefty had to admit he was good at his job.
   No security assault team came boiling out to wel- come them. Lefty didn't have to kill any welcoming par- ty, didn't have to line up her old-fashioned sights and cutting-edge smartscope, didn't have to adjust the rifle's front-end with her inhumanly precise cyberlimb and squeeze with her flesh-and-blood trigger-finger for the exactly two pounds, five ounces, that would smear some idiot guard's grey matter all over the nice, clean, feng- shui-fancy facility walls.
Good.
   She watched the last of them go in-did that Coydog girl shoot her a thumbs up?-and then Lefty swung her scope to scan upward, toggling through light-amplifica- tion mods and looking through what windows she had access to.


"There's been some gang activity, though, Chipped Ra- zors," Duska worried, voice carrying more than Sledge liked, "So I'm a little worried about leaving Lefty alone out there. Perhaps I should have left my spirit out there to protect her?"
   "She seems nice," Coydog smiled, then straightened her features, "I mean, for a professional killer and all. Very competent and professional. I'm sure she'll be fine."


6	SYNCHRONICITY




   "You two are gonna get us killed," Sledge turned his head over his shoulder to grumble. Omni-directional grumbling wasn't something he'd had implanted-it was just a natural knack.
   "Shh," Coydog glowered, "We're communicating and coordinating between teams. Transparency is important in a healthy relationship."
   Duska lifted an intrigued eyebrow. Tiny winced on Sledge's behalf. Myth snorted in a supremely unladylike fashion. Gentry snickered, but kept hacking the elevator controls.
   "And besides, I have a spirit concealing us." Coydog timed it just right so her explanation coincided with Sledge opening his dumb mouth to say another dumb thing. "Nobody'll hear anyways."
   "<Heh heh heh,>" Hardpoint weighed in via au- dio-link.
Sledge wisely stayed quiet.


"Ninth floor's us," Sledge stepped out as the elevator doors slid open, sweeping one side of the hallway with his Raiden assault rifle. At his back, Tiny swung the oth- er way, huge blade up.
"You sure you're okay, boss?"
   Myth gave them both a warm smile. "We'll be fine without you. Tenth floor's where Coy does her magic."
   Sledge's cyberoptics had already slid off of the troll leader, though, and he cast a worried look at Coydog. Gentry pointedly looked away.
   "Go cover Tiny while he does his job. I've got Myth and Gentry and Alyosha and-oh yeah!-fraggin' Bear and Coyote coverin' me while I do mine. I'm good."
   She didn't blow him a kiss or shoot him a wink or call him sugar-wooger-noogums. Sledge's cheeks still flushed, though, Myth still stifled a smile, Gentry still looked away.
The elevator doors closed, and the car kept lifting. "<Still clear. Hostiles on floors four and way up on
twenty,>" Lefty said through the microphone built into her cyber-wrist, near enough her face in her prone shooting position. "<Proceed as planned.>"
   She emphasized the planned enough to make Tiny roll his eyes and Alyosha to feel a little guilty, but nobody else seemed to pick up on it.
   Just like she didn't seem to pick up on the pair of gangers whispering at one another, blades out, as they climbed up the fire escape behind her.


Coydog moved fast, squeezing out of the elevator ahead of Myth and even Gentry, Duska in her wake. The fa- cility-the whole megacorporation-was well-known for

meticulously arraying every little thing just so, aligning their offices with the flow of chi energy that surround- ed and enveloped metahumanity, whether they were aware of it or not. Some attributed it to ley lines, oth- ers to emotional claptrap, others to simply nature's will; what mattered was that Coydog could see it, could feel it, and she followed this tenth-floor's flow of power to her target.
   Duska was just a step behind her, the spirit whisper- er as attuned to the supernatural as Coydog, in his own way. Gentry chewed at his lip and hurriedly wiped cam- eras as he trailed them, and Myth took up the rear of the group, her shadowy bulk reassuring at their six.
   "Ooh," Coydog finally smiled, casting a glance at Gen- try and knowing the decker would already be working on that last security door. Through the thick safety glass, inside the central experimentation chamber of this floor of the building, an ornate metal bracer veritably blazed with power.
"What's it do?" Duska whispered.
   "Somethin' neat," Coydog shrugged. The mundane security was Gentry's job. The wards, inlaid into the floor, were hers. "Johnson's paying a pretty penny, that's all we really know."
   "Orichalcum?" The dwarf peered over on his tip-toes. The magical metal was phenomenally powerful, and equally expensive.
   "The inlays for sure." Coydog nodded, "And maybe some of that big stuff, too."
   Her wrinkled nose and gesture took in not only the gorgeous bracer they were here to steal, but also larger, heavier pieces. Broken lengths of pillar, an ancient-look- ing section of wall covered in runic carvings, a lovely marble statue that looked to be wearing metallic jewelry. "I think so, too," Duska sighed. None of the heavier items would leave the room, he was sure. "They're beau-
tiful. That's too bad."


Sledge stalked the cubicle walls with paramilitary preci- sion, his move-by-wire upgrades making every footfall sure and certain, his street-earned experience keeping his gun steady.
"So what's with 'Tiny,' anyways?" he grunted. "Hmm?" Tiny didn't look up from his satchel. "It's ironic, right? Call the big guy 'Tiny,' I mean?" "Prob'ly," the troll shrugged, busy.
   Sledge grunted back, then the pair moved most of the way across the room. They were near the central area, ducking from cubicle to cubicle.
   "So, uh," Sledge tried to remember Coydog and Myth's lessons on the importance of small talk. "How'd you meet Myth?"


SYNCHRONICITY	7



   "Hmm?" Tiny was halfway under a desk again, shoul- ders too broad to fit, stretching out one long arm to reach something.
   "Myth." Sledge tried not to sound grouchy. He really, really tried. "How d'you know her?"
   "School," Tiny said as they moved to their fourth such pit-stop. His big machete was never quite in the way, he seemed as practiced at moving with it as Sledge was with his rifle and sword.
"Like a ... a tech school or something?"
   Tiny looked up, clambering to his feet after wedging himself beneath this last desk.
"Why?"
Sledge shrugged.
   "Figure smoothies won't let a troll into most schools. Thought, like, a vocational school or whatever might've been it. Myth there as some long con, you lookin' for work before The Man kicked you out ..."
   "<Movement!>" Lefty interrupted them, a heartbeat before Hardpoint's static-crackling voice did the same, a split-second before his gun-drones started firing a floor above them. Lefty sounded out of breath. Sledge didn't notice it. Tiny did.
   The pair of them began to move-straight at the stair- well, running toward the trouble-but then flashlights split the darkness of the work-stations behind them. Underbarrel-mounted flashlights, carried on guns, car- ried by guards.
   "Go help the others," Sledge dropped to one knee, bracing his Raiden against a flimsy wall, half-concealing himself and ready to open fire on the first guard that stepped fully into view. "I'll hold 'em here, you finish the gig."
"I will."
   Tiny ran for the stairwell, and Sledge-firing a tight burst into an armored guard-didn't notice that the troll went down, not up, the stairs.


The guards had a security mage. Had.
   Gentry's Colt snapped off quick shots whenever the decker wasn't ducked behind something and hacking furiously. Myth's Ingram Smartguns let out long roars of autofire as she sprayed and drew fire, hollering or- ders to the rest of the team over the chattering guns. Hardpoint's drones swooped and roared, laying down suppressive fire or flying up to flank a hunkered-down guard. Occasionally a window got a neat little hole blast- ed in it, and somewhere across the room, as if by magic, a security thug went down, as-across the street-Lefty shifted her aim for another shot.
Coydog and Duska? They had to handle the mage. The young combat magician, fresh-faced enough he




looked like a fuzzy-cheeked recent graduate of Some- thing Or Another Tactical Sorcery Academy, had started strong. Very strong. Too strong. Coydog had barely coun- tered the Fireball he'd decided to open with, and the elf 's features turned grim when she thought about what would've happened had she not snuffed out the spell.
   Going straight to a loud combat-casting like that was a rookie move. It showed impatience with the ebb and flow of combat, a lack of willingness to wait for the right moment, an inability to pause and survey the opposi- tion. It showed an eagerness to prove oneself to peers or superiors. Pulling out a big gun so early showed immatu- rity, maybe even fear.
Most of all? It showed that you were the mage.
   The young Wuxing caster got hit with a tornado, es- sentially, sucked into a raging whirlwind of Coydog's current air spirit, dashed against the ceiling, then the floor, then cast aside.
   Then, getting shakily to his feet, glowing with pow- er-again-as he mustered up a healing spell to try to repair his bruises and cracked bones, he got mauled by a rather unexpected bear.
   Duska shook his head sadly as the team's fighting withdrawal continued.
   "So young." The dwarf 's glowing blue bear spirit roared and clawed and charged off toward some heavily armored troopers that had Gentry pinned down. Duska sighed, "You should've stayed down, my boy."


Lefty saw Tiny first, the massive wall of troll-meat smash- ing the front security doors open-the wrong way-with a battering ram-more precisely, a dwarf in now-cracked Wuxing combat armor. The troll's big machete was wet with blood, and Lefty suppressed a shudder as she lined up a shot and squeezed for a hair over a kilo.
   Hardpoint's van rushed onto the scene next, a GMC Bulldog, as customized as you could hope for. Security came spilling out of a side door, but the van slewed to a sideways halt just in time for its armored hide to de- flect incoming fire. The doorway was covered as Alyo- sha, Myth, and the rest came stumbling out, fighting a rear-action.
   No, Lefty lined up a headshot, applied another kilo of pressure, and ended a life. But not all of them. She checked the chronometer in her heads-up display.
"<Tick, tock,>" was all she said, and all she had to. "<Sledge!>" Tiny went rushing back down the hall-
way for just a few seconds, and when he came back out, there weren't any more guards firing from inside the building. "<Sledge, you gotta get outta there, big guy.>"
   Lefty shifted, squinted, saw figures still moving on the ork's ninth floor, muzzle flashes still barking.

   She wondered-another squeeze, another fallen guard-if Tiny or Alyosha had ever told Myth's crew why they were here.
   "<Frag off,>" Sledge's fire didn't cease, but Lefty watched his bulkier silhouette move sidelong down a hallway. Moving and shooting, never standing still. A real pro. It'd be a shame if he didn't leave soon.
   "<You bein' tech-school buddies with Myth don't mean you get to tell me->"
   "<It wasn't technical school, sweetie. Not that there's anything wrong with that,>" Myth cut in as she reload- ed, then she leaned back around the van to lay down another whole magazine of fire. "<Sledge, Tiny's got his Master's. He's a structural engineer.>"
   The twin-team's commlinks buzzed with a hurried image message, a photo showing a detonator and a dwindling countdown, a tiny-looking electronic device held in Tiny's massive off-hand.
   "<You really should jump soon, Sledge-a-roonie,>" Tiny growled.
"<Or don't.>" That earned Gentry a punch from Coydog.


Everything's easier with a running start.
   Sledge chewed at the nearby wall with a long burst, emptying his Yamaha Raiden in the process. The mir- ror-shined windows gave way, splitting the night air with jagged edges. He ran, built up speed, and leaped. His cyberarms cleared the way for him, battering aside the last brittle edges, and the few small cuts that got through to his meat were nothing compared to the fact he was leaping from a ninth-floor window.
Got a job to do, gravity or not.
   The ork twisted, kicking his feet to bring his body around, flailing to orient himself as his move-by-wire kicked in and time slowed down. He got his Ingram in his hand as the ground-and the knot of Wuxing secu- rity troopers that had his team pinned down-loomed up at him.
   Falling straight at them, Sledge lined up his smar- tlink targeting pip and let fly. His Smartgun barked and bucked, a long, nonstop, burst, and Wuxing guards fell dead, shot at from an unlikely angle, no cover to be found.
No reason not to try.
   His free hand groped over his shoulder for his sword-a wiz blue-glowing replica from Neil's latest trid- flick, but also a monofilament-sharp blade in its own

right-and Sledge tried to angle his fall to land on one last drekhead. Might as well take one more with him.
Sorry Coyd-
   Suddenly a tornado hit him, and Sledge was fall- ing sideways instead of down. The world turned into a bouncing, shuddering, shower of sparks and bruises as the street rose up to meet him and he skipped along the pavement.
   The rear of Hardpoint's van loomed at him, the in- side cramped full of too many shadowrunners. Myth and Tiny took up half the space back there, and Alyosha ducked, and there was Coydog by one door, and at the other was Gentry, and then this weird shaggy-looking blue glowing thing-and then the world turned black, because Sledge was out cold.


Lefty watched the ork skip like a stone once, twice, and then slam right into the back of Hardpoint's van. Or, rather, into a shaggy bear-spirit who'd tried to soften his landing, and then into Gentry, and then into the van. Neither of the two meatheads got back up before the doors were slammed shut by gale-force winds and the van started to peel out, and Lefty scrambled up from her shooting position-again-and hurried to the edge of the building.
   She stepped over a pair of Chipped Razors, a local gang that had, according to recent reports, about a sev- enty percent chance of trying to pull some drek tonight. They had tried. The two corpses were mauled terribly, almost looking like one of Alyosha's ursine spirits had done a number on them.
One hadn't.
   Lefty's chromed-up arm was sticky with blood as she used it to help her vault off the roof of the building, even though all her blades had been tucked back into their concealed positions. She fell right down onto a three- point landing-rifle slung over one shoulder, safe from the impact-atop Hardpoint's van.
   She gave the Bulldog a thump-thump with her metal fist and they sped away.
   Just before they rounded the next corner, she looked back and saw the Wuxing facility split in half by a fire- ball. It then crumbled, folding at the mid-point like a pocketknife. Tiny'd been right; the judicious application of controlled explosives would disrupt the flow of chi in a pretty long-term way.
Two teams, one facility ... almost one job.

SHADOWRUN
INTRO	



We're going to start with a simple statement of fact: Shadowrun is awesome. Elves hack the Matrix, trolls sling fireballs, dwarfs channel magic into the ability to punch through a brick wall, orks charm their way past security while carrying a massive firearm in case their words don't work, dragons run globe-spanning megacorporations-the list of compelling characters and fascinating story possibilities in the Sixth World could go on forever.
   Which is the goal of this book. Shadowrun: Anar- chy is all about giving players a chance to let loose a flood of stories in the Shadowrun universe, to chase your imagination into whatever dark corner or dis- tant swamp it wanders into, and to see just what kind of chaos you can unleash. Anarchy serves as a com- plement to Shadowrun, Fifth Edition; while SR5 offers opportunities for detailed simulations of your charac- ter's choices using rules with significant depth, in An- archy the story comes first. There are still plenty op- portunities to throw dice, because we love doing that, but those opportunities exist to help the story move forward. And in Anarchy, every player's contributions to the story can stretch beyond the actions of their characters. They have the chance to add elements to the story, from the appearance of new characters to the existence of strange magic to descriptions of strange objects and more. They get to challenge each other, but most of all they get to throw in ideas that will make the game exciting and memorable, and that will help them experience the things that have made Shadowrun one of the most enduring role-playing set- tings of all time.
This book is all you need to play Shadowrun: An-
archy (with the exception of some six-sided dice, but you can dig some of those up, right?), and it is de- signed to make it easy to jump into the game. Here's what you'll find: First, you'll see The Bleeding Edge, your guide to Shadowrun's Sixth World setting and the role your character will play in it. The Rules of the Street gives you everything you need to resolve situ-



ations and conflicts in the game, so you know which dice to roll and when-and what to look for when you roll. The next two chapters give some advice for playing the game, as well as some alternate rules to suit different styles. Building Street Cred focuses on players and what they can do to make the game as fun as possible, while Controlling Anarchy is advice for gamemasters about how to help build exciting and memorable stories. While the book includes many pre-generated characters to help you dive into the ac- tion, Forces of Chaos guides you through the process of creating your own character to be just what you want it to be, as well as how to develop that character as it gains experience. Street People has that afore- mentioned collection of pre-generated characters, with a wide array of people such as a human razorgirl, an ork illusionist, a troll bruiser, and a dwarf parkour adept. It also has non-player characters and beasts that can be easily dropped into any job.
   Speaking of jobs, the next two chapters have re- sources needed to set runners out onto the streets to get their work done. The Secrets of Seattle gives the background of the most iconic city in the Sixth World, the shadowrunner haven of Seattle, with places for runners to go, people to meet, and plot hooks to fuel their adventures. The Happening World is a collection of Contract Briefs, plotlines gamemasters can use to send the group out on a job, giving them the tools they need to get the game moving and provide some plot twists on the way. Finally, Anarchy and Shadow- run, Fifth Edition talks about how the two current rule sets work together, and how to move characters from one rule set to another. It also has a list of gear, spells, weapons, and more for ease of reference.
   That's what the book has. Check it out, get a feel for it, then get ready for make your own characters, tell your own stories, and build your own legends on the mean streets of the Sixth World. Shadowrun may be awesome, but you're about to make it better.

INTRODUCTION	11

SHADOWRUN
BLEEDING ON THE EDGE

The first thing that you need to know about the Sixth World is that what you don't know absolutely will kill you. So will what you do know. In fact, it's safe to assume that anything and anyone you see or don't see has both the potential and the desire to kill you.
   That's good info to know, but not enough to keep you alive. If you're going to run in the shadows, you're going to do the kind of drek that can make everyone in the world-law enforcement, corp security, some average dude who doesn't like the way you look-angry and/or scared, and they'll often react to that anger/fear combi- nation by trying to take you out. If you want to stay alive and keep getting hired to run the shadows, you need to know how the world works. So here's a rundown of what the Sixth World is, how it got there, and some of the power players who make sure a few people stay on top while the vast majority of the people wriggle uncomfort- ably under their mighty thumbs.

 EVERYTHING HAS A PRICE 
Read the sentence in the header there. Read it again. Got it? Good. Because if that's the only thing you take away from this, if that's the only thing you learn, then you'll still be getting something valuable about the world you live in. You walk around this world, you'll see a lot of heaps, and each one of them's got someone perched on top of it. Every megacorporation has its CEO, govern- ments have their chief executive, gangs have their lieu- tenant or head man or chief head basher or whatever the hell they decide to call it. Even that one block in the barrens that has nothing more than a rusty dumpster, an abandoned car, and a shed whose roof has caved in

has a scary-eyed guy named Rastool who scared off all the other scary-eyed guys so he can claim that spot as his own. Each of them figured out what they would have to pay to get to the top of that particular heap, and each one of them ponied up when the time came and paid it. So this is what you need to know. If we're going to talk about payments, we need to talk about currency.
What I mean is, we need to look at the things you might need to give up in order to get ahead.

MAGIC: PAYING WITH YOUR MIND 
When magic came back into the world in 2011 (didn't know about that? Better check the timeline further down) and elves, dwarves, orks, and trolls started scratching and clawing for power alongside humans, it didn't take too long for people to start trying to get a handle on how to use all the new mana floating around for themselves. Turned out some people had a knack for it. While the rest of us were wondering what they were looking at with glazed eyes and weird expressions, they were figuring out how to channel and shape streams of mana-a sort of magic energy that seems to be just about everywhere. Turns out, if you can suss how it's done, you can use mana to set the air on fire, make people do things they'd never do, or other truly esoteric and/ or insane things. And mana wasn't just for the spells and stuff we think of as magic. It gave some people the strength to punch through walls, others can shame a cobra with their reflexes, and there are some who can outrun a cheetah; and that's just scratching the surface. And you know all those magic goodies from legends and fairytales and myths? We got 'em all. Enchanted swords, magic rings, wands, amulets, mojo bags, every potion

you can think of all exist. Not that they always work the way they did in the stories. Don't just grab the sword of a legendary warrior and expect to slice and dice like she did, for example. But, magic is out there, and people are using it. It's not easy-it can be draining, physically and mentally, and some people push themselves to the point where their sanity drips out of their ears in a nice, steady trickle. That's the price, and it's often gladly paid.

CORPORATIONS: PAYING WITH YOUR SELF 
The way corporations work in the Sixth World isn't really anything new. It's just the latest iteration of the might- makes-right way of doing things. There's a lot of legal history we could cover to help you see how things got to this point, but in the end it boils down to one word: ex- traterritoriality. That's the word that allows corporations to say that whatever happens in their holdings, on the buildings and lands they own, is subject to their laws- and no one else's. Gaining extraterritorial status was a long-held dream of many of the world's largest corpora- tions, and when judicial decisions in nations across the world gave it to them, they spent several years pissing on themselves and each other in utter delirium. Then they figured out their infighting was cutting into their bottom line, so they cut back on fighting each other and concentrated on pissing on the rest of us.
   Not every corporation in the world has extraterrito- rial status. To understand who does, you have to know about the Corporate Court, the body the megacorpora- tions created when they realized they were spending too much time solving their disputes by ravaging en- tire small countries. The Corporate Court is sometimes mocked as a toothless entity, a puppet of the world's largest megacorps, but its thirteen justices manage- usually-to keep open warfare between the corps from breaking out, and that's at least worth something.
   As part of its duties, the Court has created a rank- ing system to tell you how big and powerful a particular corp is. At the top is the Big Ten, the AAA-rated, corps, the most powerful megacorps in the world. The main thing you need to understand is that these guys are big- ger than big. Think of the world's largest manufacturer of computer equipment. Then add in a powerful magic supplies broker. Throw in a few banks, an insurance firm, an entertainment conglomerate, and a snack-food giant, and you're still not a tenth of the way to forming one of the Big Ten. They employ millions and control trillions of nuyen. Each and every one of them owns a piece of land within one hundred kilometers of you, unless you're in the Sahara, the Amazon, or at the bottom of the ocean. And maybe even then. These are the people in the world who have the nuyen, and we want it, which means they

determine what the rules of the game are. We just play it-and see how far those rules can bend.

AUGMENTATIONS:
PAYING WITH YOUR SOUL 
Every bit of who you are can be improved with the right piece of gear. Think you've got quick reflexes? You can be quicker, thanks to an artificial neural network that'll make you faster than a nervous jackrabbit. Think you're strong? Switch out the muscles you were born with for a set that's been custom-grown for power and efficiency, and you'll take strong to a whole new level. Think you're charming? Implant a set of specialized pheromone dis- pensers, and people will swoon when you walk by and nod enthusiastically when you talk.
   And that's just for starters. You can put actual plates of armor on your skin, or lace your bones with metal so your fists and legs deliver crushing blows. You can make your senses sharper, your brain faster, and you can im- plant knowledge you never learned in school. (Possi- bly because you never went to school). You can replace entire pieces of your body with artificial replicas full of extra strength, nimble agility, secret compartments, and hidden weapons that provide very unpleasant surprises at just the right time.
   But it's not free. And we're not just talking money; there's a higher price to pay. All this stuff is useful and great, but it's artificial, and your body knows it. Each time you get one of these augmentations, you give up a piece of yourself. You lose something inside of you, the essence of metahumanity. We don't quite understand what "it" is, but we know this much-the more artifi- cial you make yourself, the farther you get from actual life. If you get too far, whatever animated you is going to disappear, until all the gear you bought just collapses and becomes indistinguishable from any other pile of silicon, steel, and chrome. So go ahead and get yourself augmented up, but understand that each time you do this, another piece of your metahumanity slides away.

LIFE IN THE SHADOWS:
PAYING WITH YOUR BLOOD 
The megacorporations of the world prefer a docile popu- lation, a world of people who do whatever work they're told, build anything, carry anything, sacrifice anything for the mega, and then spend all their money in the company store and be glad they got it so good. Sheep. That's how megacorps see metahumanity: a vast herd of sheep they have to keep in line to serve their purposes.

   Which means the rest of us face a stark choice: Ac- cept their drek. Or not.
   For some of us, corp life is not a life. The megacorps own enough in the world. They don't need to own us. So we drop out and find another way. We do the jobs corps won't parcel out to their regular employees, the things they don't want connected back to them. Espionage work; missions of theft, sabotage, and assault-maybe even assassination, if you swing that way. That's how we survive. We still have to dance to the corporate tune to some degree, but if we live right and build up our skills, we can become the best at what we do and get paid what we deserve. Then, maybe, instead of being one of us, scrambling under the heels of the powerful, we can be one of them, and remake a small part of the world in our image.
   But if we're going to survive, we have to find work. There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of jobs out there. You can make money off them, but each one will cost you something. You'll get a scar from a bullet that should have killed you. A leg that aches in the cold 'cause you broke it crashing your motorcycle on one of your less-perfect getaways. A missing arm because you were standing just a bit too close to a bomb going off, and a working cyber model is pricy. A fried brain lobe from lingering in the Matrix a second too long with security closing in on you. And that's just what will happen to






























your body. You'll be double-crossed, betrayed, and aban- doned. You'll see trusted friends turn on you and watch others die right in front of you. You'll have every last bit of you tested in ways you can't imagine just to see how much you can endure.
   And if you succeed? If you stay alive? Money, first of all, but more. You become a legend. You join the ranks of the people we tell stories about, the shadowrunners whose names we all know. Dirk Montgomery. FastJack. Sally Tsung. The Smiling Bandit. You'll have lived your own life, survived, and even thrived. You'll have stuck it to every man the Sixth World has to offer.
As long as you can pay the price.

 DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD 
You know how when you meet some piece-of-drek punk ganger in an alley, and he's all full of mouthy attitudes and sucker punches, and you find yourself thinking how if you looked into that little dirtball's past and learned more about his parents and upbringing, you'd under- stand how he became such a bastard? Well, our world is a lot like that. I'll give you some of the highlights from the past that made the world into the snot-nosed ass- hole we all know and barely tolerate.

The infamous Shiawase Decision in the United States Supreme Court gives multinational corporations the same rights and priv- ileges as sovereign governments. The era of national govern- ments as the chief drivers of global events comes to an end.


Realizing they had only been half-heartedly exploiting Native Americans for the past century or so, the U.S. government puts their whole heart back into the job and lets corporations run roughshod over the resources found in Native American reser- vations during the so-called Resource Rush. This leads to unrest and resistance with serious consequences.


Virally Induced Toxic Allergy Syndrome (VITAS) appears in New Delhi, India. Eventually it kills a quarter of the world's population.


The Awakening, or at least the beginning of it. Dragons appear, people develop talents and abilities that can only be described as magic, babies are born in ways that exactly resemble elves and dwarfs of legend, and the world reveals itself to generally be much weirder than anyone ever suspected.


After the Great Ghost Dance of the previous year, in which Na- tive American shamans spurred natural disasters such as earth- quakes and volcanic eruptions across the globe, the United States and Canada agree to the Treaty of Denver, in which large

portions of both nations are given to aboriginal populations to become the various states that make up the Native American Nations of the Western Hemisphere.


In a process known as Goblinization, some adults spontaneous- ly mutate into creatures that become known as orks and trolls (a wider range of forms emerge as time passes). People react with fear and loathing, which, after more than half a century, has gen- erally eased to fear and extreme distaste-though some people prefer to stick with loathing. Dwarfs, elves, trolls, orks, and the like are collectively labeled "metahumanity," though sometimes the label is broadened to include all forms of human-like life, including humans themselves, which irks the troll-haters to no end.


The Matrix, the interconnected wonder of the computer world, crashes, and crashes hard. The virus that caused the Crash takes years to eradicate, and the whole dynamic sets the stage for cyberwarfare in the years to come.


After losing a lot of territory to the Native American Nations, the remnants of the United States and Canada merge to form the United Canadian and American States (UCAS). In subse- quent years, the Free State of California, the Confederation of American States, and the Caribbean League claim parts of what used to be the United States. This mirrors political fracturing and re-alignment occurring around the world.


BLEEDING ON THE EDGE	15






The fear and loathing against elves, dwarfs, orks, and trolls (par- ticularly the latter two groups) comes to a head in the Night of Rage, a worldwide series of riots targeting metahumans and their families. The pain and scars inflicted that night still linger, nearly forty years later.


After a cult known as the Universal Brotherhood introduces the vile creepies known as bug spirits to the world, Chicago became the most infested city on the planet. When containment didn't seem to be solving the problem, the Ares Corporation set off a nuke in the city, an event known as the Cermak Blast. The com- bined infestation of bugs, removal of anything resembling law and order, and destruction levied by the nuke made central Chi- cago the blasted wonderland it is today.


The citizens of the UCAS collectively throw their hands in the air, say "What the hell?", and elect a dragon named Dunkelzahn as president. Dunkelzahn serves for just under ten and a half hours before being blown to kingdom come. A huge astral rift hovers at the scene of the assassination for years.


Halley's comet passes by and shakes up the world. It initiates the Sudden Unexplained Recessive Genetic Expression (SURGE) event, bringing changelings to the world as some people take on animal characteristics. A new dragon named Ghostwalker emerges from the rift left by Dunkelzahn's assassination and decides to take up residence as the tyrant of Denver. For good measure, increased storms, earthquakes, and volcanic erup- tions keep the entire population of the world on their toes.


The combination of a massive corporate IPO, the machinations of a crazed artificial intelligence, and an assault by a terrorist group known as Winternight bring about the Second Matrix Crash, or Crash 2.0. A new Matrix emerges in its wake, bringing wireless accessibility to all. Also emerging: technomancers, who can access the Matrix with nothing more than their mind. This causes many to freak out.


After campaigning for years about the lack of security in the wire- less Matrix, activist and philanthropist Danielle de la Mar convinc- es the corporations of the world to revamp Matrix protocols to be stricter, less open, and more subject to corporate control. Because that was something they really needed to be talked into doing.


A new condition known as cognitive fragmentation disorder (CFD) is spotted, where people suddenly and abruptly com- pletely change their personalities, or become a battleground for warring personalities. A hybrid technological/biological virus is identified as the source, developed by artificial intelligences held captive for megacorporate research as a way to gain free- dom for copies of themselves, if not their actual selves.



Spread of the CFD virus continues, with an especially aggres- sive strain leading to most of Boston being quarantined. While infections finally eased toward the end of the year, the lockdown in Boston remained, and the next step in the AIs' aggression to- ward humanity is uncertain.

 OPPOSITION REPORT 
You know there are going to be people trying to stop you from doing the job you've been hired to do-if there weren't, you wouldn't be making nuyen one, because any simpleton could take care of the work. Lots of shadowrun- ners have ended up dead in an alley somewhere because they underestimated the strength of the opposition, or because they didn't understand all the interests involved in a run, and just who might be coming after them. The next few sections will help you not be like them, telling you about the wide range of people and things that might get in your way as you try to get drek done.

 THE BIG TEN 
The Big Ten megacorporations of the world control vast amounts of the world's resources and cash, along with employing a large percentage of the planet's population. They make the world keep spinning-and have the pow- er to make it stop in short order. Any runner who lasts for more than a week or two is going to end up working for or against one or more of them, so it's best to know what you're up against. Here's a rundown:

   Most shadowrunners know Ares from their Ares Arms division, and with good reason. The Ares Predator is the staple sidearm for the discern- ing runner. Run by wealthy playboy Damien Knight, the corp has a reputa- tion as a very "American" outfit: gung- ho, militaristic, patriotic, and individ- ualistic- Mom and apple pie, in other
words. Don't let that fool you-sure, they're one of the better megas to work shadow ops for, but keep your eyes open, because they can be as underhanded as the

rest. And lately, they have an edge of desperation. The complete failure of the Ares Excalibur gun was the first visible symptom, but as time as past it has become clear that there is a rot at the heart of Area, an ongoing war that is claiming some of their best talent. Wheth- er they will survive this war and regain their swagger or be weakened to the point that their many enemies start tearing them limb from limb is not yet clear.
   Ares specializes in law enforcement, military hard- ware and arms, aerospace (they have five orbital hab- itats), entertainment, automotive (the former General Motors is also part of the Ares family), and smaller di- visions in many other areas. Oh, and they own Knight Errant, one of the largest private law enforcement firms on the planet.

Corporate Slogan: "The Way to a Better Tomorrow"
Corporate Status: AAA, private corporation World Headquarters: Tenochtitlán, Aztlan President/CEO: Flavia de la Rosa
You Know Them For: Great PR, selling microwave burritos at thousands of worldwide locations. Also, ruthlessness and blood magic, but they keep those under wraps.
   If you've bought any kind of consum- er goods recently, chances are you've contributed to Aztechnology's bottom line. Sixty percent of the goodies you find at your local Stuffer Shack come from the Big A-and plenty of the ma-
terial that went into building it came from them, too. They make everything from chemicals to trideo-game software to military goods and magical supplies. They've got their fingers in more pies than just about any oth- er mega, to the point that they essentially own an en- tire nation, the large bridge between North and South America known as Aztlan. On top of that, their public relations campaigns are second to none. Which is good, because they're also all about blood magic and evil con- spiracies. Allegedly. Just don't say anything about that within earshot of the Big A's ferocious legal team.
   The corp also has a gift for attracting-or attacking- powerful enemies. From the war they fought against Am- azonia to the grudge that Ghostwalker, the tyrant dragon of Denver, has against them, they boast some of the most powerful enemies in the world. Since their enemies can

sling around some pretty serious mojo, Aztechnology's magic research work has focused on how they can outpace anyone and everyone in the magic department. Just don't expect to see headlines about that sort of work, since it's not the sort of thing that's done in the public eye.

EVO CORPORATION 
Corporate Court Ranking (2078): 7 Corporate Slogan: "Evo Is Acceptance" Corporate Status: AAA, public corporation World Headquarters: Vladivostok, Russia President: Yuri Shibanokuji
You Know Them For: A billion commercials pitying you for not be- ing awesome enough to sport their entire line of enhancements and augmentations
   "EVOlve," they say in all their ads. Let's be fair, they are a megacorp that looks to the future. Their CEO is an ork and their largest stock-hold- er is a free spirit. They focus a lot
on transhumanist projects ranging from bioware cyber- netics, anti-aging experiments, and other even more out-there projects designed to take metahumanity to the next stage of evolution. On top of that, they're the first megacorp to successfully set up a base on Mars. Evo leads the megas in goods and services designed with orks, trolls, elves, dwarfs, changelings, and other non- human people in mind. Their corporate culture is pretty touchy-feely, but don't freak-they can be as cold and calculating as any other mega. As one of the two corps conducting research on artificial intelligences that even- tually led to the CFD outbreak, Evo is facing anger from the rest of the world, including their AAA peers, making their current work treacherous. The recent death of their CEO Anatoly Kirilenko at the hands of shadowrunners shows just how treacherous it can be.

   Horizon is based in the midst of media wonderland Los Angeles, and they've managed to score many ex- clusive contracts for dealing with the development of California. With
charismatic ex-simstar Gary Cline at the helm, Horizon specializes in anything that can be used to manipulate opinion (media, advertising, entertainment, social net- working, etc.), along with consumer goods and services, real estate and development, and pharmaceuticals. Its corporate culture is "people-centered," and employees are well taken care of and encouraged to develop their talents and pursue their interests on company time-as long as the corp reaps the profits. They had been re- nowned as being technomancer friendly, but a series of events culminating in a massacre in Las Vegas helped people understand that even the nicest of megacorps can spin out of control. They have redesigned the com- plicated software called the Consensus that helps them shape their decision-making process, with the hope they will not go so far astray again. Seeing weakness in two of their peers due to the CFD crisis, they are leading a PR charge that they hope will boost their standing in the Big Ten.

The corp pays very well for success in shadowruns, but when you fail, they ... disapprove.

The question now is whether he can pull off the same trick a third time, as NeoNET seems to be teetering on the brink of disaster. If there is a spot between "reeling" and "free-falling," that is where NeoNET resides. Along with Evo, the corp is tak- ing the blame for the CFD virus, and unlike Evo they have not been able to adapt to the challenges they are facing. With many key personnel and facilities lost in the Boston quarantine, NeoNET is bleeding, and plenty of megacor-

resources, though-NeoNET is the primary power behind the Grid Overwatch Division, and they practically invent- ed the wireless Matrix. Needless to say, they're heavily invested in Matrix infrastructure, along with cyberware, electronics, software, biotech, aerospace, small arms, and many other areas. To survive, NeoNET will have to draw on these strengths and unite a sometimes-divid- ed corporation, which has major factions controlled by a long-time corporate raider, a reclusive dwarf, and the great dragon Celedyr. Runs for or against NeoNET are a grab-bag, now more than ever. Randomness can be fun, until that time you end up reaching in the bag and pull- ing out a scorpion.

You Know Them For: Perhaps being single-handedly responsible for the adage: "Never cut a deal with a dragon."
   Saeder-Krupp Heavy Industries can be summed up in one word: Lofwyr. The great dragon owns nearly one hundred percent of this German-based megacorp, and he rules it with the kind of attention to detail that only one of his kind can
maintain. It's not impossible to put one over on Lofwyr, but it's very difficult-and usually fatal. The wyrm doesn't suffer fools gladly, and shadowrunners who go against him (or fail in one of his jobs) might just find themselves on his list-which is probably also his lunch menu.
   If anyone in S-K is lacking for motivation these days, all they have to do is look at their Corporate Court rank- ing. That number two next to their name burns cold fire in their hearts, building a steely determination to re- claim the top spot they held for so long. They have plen- ty of areas in which to try to regain market share. Their primary areas of focus are heavy industry, chemicals, fi- nance, and aerospace, but they have at least one finger in every pie the world has to offer, and they are extreme- ly anxious to start cutting themselves larger pieces.

   The oldest of the megas, Shiawase was the first corp to claim extraterrito- rial status. A classic Japanese zaibatsu, Shiawase is run in a traditional "family" style, with most employees signing life- time contracts and even marrying with- in the corp. Families, however, tend to
squabble, and plenty of runners have made good cash in the course of these quarrels. As for what they do, what don't they do? Either directly or through subsidiaries, Shiawase has its hands in nuclear power, environmental engineering, biotech, heavy industry, technical service, minerals, military goods, and a whole lot more. They also sell lots of medkits to shadowrunners, which means they sometimes see shooting runners as a business in- vestment, because every hit may mean another kit sold.

 ORGANIZED CRIME 
A lot of shadowrunners will tell you the only real differ- ence between what we do and organized crime is the or- ganized part. There's some truth in that. Shadowrunners have occasionally formed organizations, like the legend- ary Assets, Inc., but as a rule it's not something we do. People like us, we don't take orders well. We don't like to share with anyone outside of our team (or often inside it, for that matter), not to mention the fact that regimen- tation, hierarchical organization, and all that lock-step discipline are pretty much poison to us. Organized crime, on the other hand, thrives on that stuff. Organized crime does the things large numbers of people do well: deals narcotics and other addictives; runs protection rackets; operates gambling rings-just about anything that re- quires an army and turns a profit. This means organized crime can often be found deeply entwined with legiti- mate, respected businesses. In some cases, it's hard to tell where the crime ends and the business begins.
   Despite their violent reputations, the organizations that make up organized crime eschew pyrotechnics when- ever possible. Firefights bring police attention and could result in important people getting killed or otherwise in- disposed. As a general rule, the work they do goes better when no one is looking, so they put a lot of effort into keeping a low profile. But don't be confused-and don't get stupid. Just because they'd rather keep their guns hol- stered and the money flowing, don't think for a minute they won't get down and dirty when they need to.
   The Mafia is an extensive and significant presence in every major North American city, most European cities, and a lot of cities everywhere else. They like cities. They usually don't work closely with the megacorporations be- cause, let's face it, they are a megacorporation. The main difference between the recognized corps and the Mafia is that when there's infighting between Mafia's divisions, it's slightly more likely to involve high body counts.
   The Yakuza, by contrast, have tied their fortunes to Mitsuhama Computer Technologies. This is not to say that every Yakuza rengo has a connection to Mitsuha- ma-they don't, and some rengos fight tooth and nail against those who do. But the Yakuza and MCT are in- extricably tied together. As in four high-ranking Yaku- za between them own about forty-five percent of the megacorporation. Mitsuhama uses Yakuza foot soldiers to do their dirty work, while the Yakuza uses MCT as the greatest money-laundering organization the world has ever seen. The corporate association gives the Yakuza a ruthless efficiency; anyone who deals with them watches their manners.
   The Triads have their origins in what used to be Chi- na and differ from the other major crime networks in


20	BLEEDING ON THE EDGE




that they are decentralized-they have no central lead- ership, no supreme commander or high council or ar- bitration committee. This can mean a whole new set of protocols when you move from one Triad's turf to an- other; what kept you alive in one place might kill you in the next. Their lack of central leadership means conflict resolution within the Triads is often bloody and bru- tal-though they are capable of considerable restraint and finesse if the situation calls for it. The lack of central control also makes them more flexible in adapting to- and taking over-new territories. If they ever got over their cultural prejudice against women in authority and non-human metatypes in general, they'd own a lot big- ger piece of the pie. The Triads have the usual gambling, drugs, and prostitution operations, but their specialty is Awakened drugs. For some reason the Triads attract a disproportionate percentage of mages, which makes them very efficient at finding, testing, and preparing the drugs with the best street value.
   Remember when I told you organized crime liked to keep a low profile, avoid the spotlight, and keep atten- tion off itself? I was not talking about the Russian Vory v Zakone. They can't match the money and manpower of the other major syndicates, so their primary public rela- tions tool is intimidation. Their go-to negotiation tech- nique is blunt brutality; the first indication the Vory have entered a new area is usually the bodies of criminals who thought it was their turf. The Vory want to shake things up, and they hit every confrontation at a full charge, loud and raging. It doesn't always work, but I'll tell you this- no one ever likes to see these guys coming.
   In the Hopi tradition, Koshare is the spirit of over- do- ing things-gluttonous, disruptive, and irreverent, the uni- versal cautionary example. Koshare does all the things people should not do, illustrating why they should never do them. Which is why the network of Na- tive American organized crime rings call themselves the Koshari. They do all the things you would expect an or- ganized crime outfit to do, but they're especially skilled at talislegging, the illicit smuggling of magical reagents and telesma. If you're a t-bird pilot in the western half of North America, depending on the impression you make on the Koshari, you'll either be recruited, warned off their territory, or shut down hard.

 GANGS 
We don't have the room or the time to fill you in on all the gangs that are banging around whatever sprawl you're sitting in right now. Small places seem to get by with just one gang, but get much over two thousand locals and you're probably going to have two or more



gangs. Over a million locals, and you're talking a healthy gang network. You should take the time to figure out that network-doing one gang's work on another's turf is more likely to get you killed if you don't know that's what you're doing.
   There are two types of gangs, and by and large as a runner you're most likely to come across versions of both types pretty regularly. Street gangs are all about territory. A few broken blocks, a handful of abandoned buildings, the streets around their favorite dive, fifteen different piles of brick, a neighborhood, you name it. Whatever they've got, it's theirs. They don't always know what to do with it-maybe deal minor drugs or run half-assed protection rackets-but they'll defend it against all com- ers. Which usually means hanging out and challenging anyone they don't know to a fight. There are street gangs that aren't all about the territory. Some gangs are racially based, like Seattle's elf-only Ancients; some are bound together by a common interest, like the Halloweeners, who dress up like ghouls to terrify and assault civilians unfortunate enough to cross their path. As a general rule, gangers are young, raw, untrained, unpredictable, quick-tempered, and eager to mix things up. So yeah, if the needs of whatever job you're on do not require you to deal with them, avoid gangs. Unless you think your evening would be much improved by a fistfight.


BLEEDING ON THE EDGE	21



   What street gangs do to a collection of sprawl blocks, go-gangs do to highways. Riding around on souped-up cycles and choppers, these gang members look for any driver who shows a milligram of fear. The least hesita- tion, such as looking like you're thinking things over, can trigger an attack. This could be a ram, or it could be a game of head-on chicken against a foe with a sawed-off shotgun propped on his handlebar. There's no point to their attacks-the attack is the point. They are random, indiscriminate, and leap to violence the way a frog leaps to water. Know where the go-gangs in whatever sprawl you're in and avoid them.

 THE LAW 
The most annoying thing local politicos can do is sic local law enforcement on you, because local ain't local anymore. Back in the day, law enforcement was a tangle of local, state, and federal authorities doing their own things-barely talking to one another and almost never sharing data. Oh sure, if you were a serial killer they'd spread the word and be on the lookout, but if you were a burglar or practiced any other illegal trade, you could pretty much move from one jurisdiction to the next and get a fresh start with no one being the wiser.
   These days things are both worse and better. The bad part is most sprawls save their limited budgets by pri- vatizing law enforcement-which means cops are corps. The two big boys are Lone Star, an independent corp that boasts about its tradition of no-holds-barred Texas justice (i.e., brutality), and Knight Errant, a division of Ares Macrotechnology. These two compete for big-tick- et contracts; Knight Errant recently wrestled the plum of Seattle from Lone Star's hands. Other major securi- ty providers include Sakura Security, which has a large presence in Japan, German security giant Sternschutz, France's Esprit Industries (a subsidiary of Aztechnolo- gy), and Mitsuhama's one-two punch of Parashield and Petrovski Security. These companies have international reach, and their centralized databases are everywhere they are; do something in one jurisdiction and all the others know about it. So stay out of the database. Give them nothing-your name, your picture, your favorite make of whiskey, anything-because some smart cop, or smarter program, can use that anything to finger you. The good part is that while law-enforcement corps share all data internally, it's in their best interest to make their rivals look as inept as possible-which means they never tell each other anything. So as long as you know who's covering what turf, you can still find cracks to fall into.
   But don't get cocky. Law-enforcement contracts can change hands in a blink; what's Knight Errant territory




one day may be Lone Star the next. Meaning you may be an unknown free agent one day and an actively sought fugitive the next. And be aware that many sprawls have multiple security companies in their borders-Knight Errant may have the city contract while Lone Star covers residential or maybe corporate compounds. Make sure you know who's patrolling which streets when, and who might be looking for you.

 POLITICOS 
Politicians may not have the clout they did back in the day, but there are still taxes to be collected, laws to en- force, infrastructure to be maintained, and careers to be made. Most government crap goes on way over your head. You don't need to worry about who's president or king of whatever nation you're in and almost all state and regional objectives require resources and man- pow- er beyond any runner team's inventory. What you want are the local officials-mayors, aldermen, trustees, that sort of thing-who enforce the laws, collect the taxes, fund emergency and rescue services, and try to ensure everything works. These local leaders may not be as powerful as the corps, but as long as you're on their turf, they've got a lot of ways to help you or hinder you. Good news is they're far enough down the food chain that there's a chance you can afford whatever it takes to buy their momentary cooperation. They're easier to black- mail, too. Ask around, look around, figure out whom you need to know and what you need to know about them- you never know when you're going to need them.
   Besides the actual politicians, the other people you need to know about are the policlubs. If there is any cause in the Sixth World that two or more people can agree on, they'll form a policlub around it. Sometimes the point of the club is to, you know, actually participate in politics. Other times the clubs are a cover for illegal activities, and a lot of them are just an excuse for peo- ple to get together and get wasted. Most of these groups wield no discernible power; you can pretty much ignore them. There are a few you should pay attention to.
   One is the Humanis Policlub. Elves, dwarfs, trolls, and orks have been in the world for more than five de- cades, but for some people that hasn't been long enough to get used to the idea or to like having them around. Especially the orks and trolls. Following the proud tra- dition of racist groups since the dawn of time, Humanis is dedicated to putting a friendly face on hate. They're not against anyone, they'll tell you, they're just pro-hu- man. They don't want to take anything away from the other metatypes, they just want to make sure humans get their fair share (which is pretty much everything).

MAJOR POWERS
   Nation-states aren't the major pow- ers in the world anymore, but they're not entirely without power, either, so they keep popping their heads up and causing problems for shadowrunners. At the very least, they have borders that they tend to watch, and at the most, they play power games with elections and legislation that lead to plenty of extralegal action.
   The United Canadian and American States do not dominate the globe like the former United States once did, but they still have enough wealth and military might to make people pay attention when they flex their muscles. Thanks to interna- tional gerrymandering, the major sprawl of Seattle is part of the UCAS, contribut- ing a lot of economic heft-and a good supply of shadowrunning talent.
   Just to the south of the bulk of the UCAS is the Confederation of American States. Sometimes people feel like the CAS can be ignored as the lesser young- er sibling of the UCAS, but it has the right



combination of wealth, spunk, and long- held grudges to rise up and get attention when it wants to.
   The western portion of North Ameri- ca is dominated by the Native American Nations, including the Sioux Nation in the heart of the continent, the Salish-Shidhe Council to the northwest, and the Pueb- lo Corporate Council in the southwest. These nations do not always share a common interest, but they are capable of working together often enough to keep nearby nations nervous.
   Central America is dominated by the nation of Aztlan, which nicely con- nects North and South America. The nation is essentially a subsidiary of Az- technology, serving as a breadbasket and labor-generating machine to help the corp move forward.
   The largest nation in South America is Amazonia, ruled by the dragon Hualpa. With severe restrictions on corporations and a respect for nature, Amazonia is seen



as a paradise by some, but its shadows run as deep as those of any other nation.
   In Europe, the Allied German States are an economic powerhouse, thanks in large pªrt to the overwhelming strength of Saeder-Krupp. The nation is also home to the Free City of Berlin, a hotspot of new-anarchist and anti-corporate activity. While the AGS has one megacorp,
the Japanese Imperial State has three, including the newly anointed largest megacorp in the world. With the three megacorps working together outside of Japan's borders, the strength of the na- tion touches every part of the world.
   In Africa, Kenya has gained signifi- cant strength thanks to the Kilimanjaro Mass Driver and the corporate interest surrounding it. The ghoul kingdom of Asamando has gained a different sort of strength, serving as one of the few plac- es where the Infected are welcomed and recognized as citizens.



   Humanis serves as a nexus for a whole range of like-minded groups, from the unpleasant and aggres- sive Alamos 20,000 to the ultra-violent Hand of Five. If you're a non-human, if you like a non-human, or if you're going to be traveling anywhere non-humans are going to be, you need to be aware of what Humanis and its ilk are up to. They could pop in and mess things up at any time. Be warned.
   The whole Newtonian thing about action causing reaction works with people, just like it does in physics. There are some notable pro-metahuman groups, from powerful lobbyists and organizers of the Ork Rights Commission to the radical and violence-prone Sons of Sauron. Like the anti-meta groups, these organizations are capable of causing distractions or chaos wherev- er you may be. And if you get pro-meta and anti-meta groups in the same place at the same time-well, I hope your contingency plans can deal with random explo- sions and scattered bodies.
   In addition to racists of various flavors, you also need to keep an eye out for the various iterations of neo-anar- chist policlubs. Sometimes they go by that name, just with capitals ("Neo-Anarchist"); but depending on the location and the situation they might call themselves the Panopti- cans or the Lambeth Martyrs or the People's Party or any- thing that sounds symbolic, sincere, and all about the little guy. Individual groups under the neo-anarchist policlub banner come in a variety of flavors. Some are wild-eyed

bomb throwers who think everything should be reduced to rubble before trying to build something new; some think everything should be reduced to rubble and nothing built; some are earnest reformers, working within existing systems; some want to change how nations work; some want an end to all nations; some like coffee; some like tea. What unites these disparate agendas and the people who love them is a to-the-core distrust of centralized power in all its forms and wiles. We're talking both megacorps and big government. They're all about individuals controlling their own lives, and families and communities living the way they want to live. That is enough to make them rad- icals in the eyes of anybody with any authority. They are outsiders, often criminalized by the people in power. Just like us. Which makes them natural allies-provided you have a high tolerance for rhetoric.

 MAGICAL GROUPS 
Only a small percentage of the world's population has Awakened with magic talent, and it's an even smaller group that has the kind of ability that can really make an impact. This is good and bad for spellcasters and adepts. The good news is that they generally are in demand and can find a wide variety of work options. The bad news is that, as carriers of significant and unpredictable pow- er, the Awakened are sought after by the powers of the

world in an effort to gain some control over their tal- ents-or make sure they eliminate the competition. It's tough to survive in a world where there seem to be a hundred reasons for people to geek the mage first.
   Magicians, then, band together for a lot of reasons- shared research on spells, conversation about common ar- eas of interest, protection, information on powerful mag- ical reagents and artifacts, and so on. Belonging to one of these groups can bring big benefits, but running into one of them in the course of a run can cause big headaches.
   One of the two largest magic-focused organizations in the world is the Draco Foundation, the organization started by the late dragon Dunkelzahn's estate to execute his will and carry out his wishes. These wishes included bequests related to the disposition obscure magical ar- tifacts and the creation of the Dunkelzahn Institute of Magical Research. The foundation has become a tremen- dous repository of knowledge, full of the type of people who are so dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge that they sometimes are blind to other concerns, including the well-being of people who are not them.
   The second large magical organization is the Atlante- an Foundation. It's older than the Draco Foundation and a bit more eccentric, with its belief that all magic in the Sixth World ties back to the ancient vanished civilization of Atlantis. While there is some competitiveness between the two foundations, the Atlantean Foundation received five billion nuyen from Dunkelzahn's will, which helps keep things from getting too hostile. If you're in the busi- ness of digging into rare artifacts or other strange magic, know that one or both of these organizations might be on your tail, offering stiff competition.
   Shadowrunners know that spellslingers and adepts sometimes let their powers go to their head, and no or-






















ganization reflects this more than the Illuminates of the New Dawn. They believe magic and those who wield it can lead metahumanity into a better future, and they are very persistent in working to make that future hap- pen. From running for public office to recovering arti- facts that might help them build their power, they are a very active and energetic. They are smaller than the two foundations, but the magic power and financial re- sources of the leader means they remain a force to be reckoned with.
   On the darker side is Ordo Maximus. They appear to be a group of wealthy people, mostly in Europe, who share magic research and look for ways to build their power. Not exactly a humanitarian organization, but also not vastly different than most organizations on the planet. What makes them worse is the small group of vampires at the core of the group. Most people don't know about those Infected members, but those who do worry severe- ly about vampires gaining and extending their powers.

   The Matrix is around most of us every minute of ev- ery day, so much that we don't think about it much. We just use it. Most of the time we use it as augmented real- ity (AR), an overlay that adds information and occasion- al glitz to the world around us in the form of augmented reality objects, or AROs. You can also go whole-hog and dive into virtual reality (VR), leaving your meat body be- hind for a trip into the realm of pure information. While the speed of VR is convenient for hackers, most people like the ability to use the Matrix while carrying on with their lives at the same time.
   With AR, the Matrix is constantly around you. As long as you've got the right gear, messages from friends pop up as floating windows hovering in your field of vi- sion, moving as you move. Stores you walk by tell you about their current sales customized to your preferenc- es. Music and video samples are everywhere, waiting for you to open them with a quick gesture to see if there's anything you like.
   How do these music and movies match up to your taste, and how do they know where to find you? The magic of corporate control. You see, the Matrix has gone through two major Crashes, and been re-invented after each one. After the second one, back in 2064, the Matrix made the leap to wireless, and along with that it moved into a neo-anarchist ideal of freedom and openness, a network open and accessible to anyone with the tools to log on. That lasted a good decade until the corps realized there was a resource out there they weren't exploiting. After confessing that sin to their respective clergy and saying a few Hail Marys, the corps went about setting that mistake right, instituting more controls over the Matrix so that they can better shape what goes where. Naturally, their best customers get the best bandwidth, while the less resource-endowed are left to deal with spotty access and slow traffic.
   Unless we know how to play the game. The clamp- down of corporate control has re-ignited the battle be- tween hackers and the overseers of the Matrix, as shad- owrunners look to exploit the weaknesses of the new system and stay one step ahead of security. With the Matrix being almost entirely cloud-based, storage is vast and information is everywhere, but that doesn't mean it's easy to find. Exclusive, protected hosts keep unwant- ed visitors out and carefully watch those who are there, and the agents of the Corporate Court's Grid Overwatch Division are everywhere. If you want to try something illicit on the Matrix, remember that GOD is watching.
   But that's mostly another topic. For now, just know that everyone and everything is on the Matrix, but the easiest things to find are the things programmers are betting you want to buy.



 GETTING AROUND 
One thing you need to always remember in the Sixth World-after "Everything has a price"-is corporations love predictability and live to control. Take GridGuide, marketed as the ultimate convenience for the commut- er. It's a programmed control system for your personal vehicle that takes you where you want to go with lit- tle input from you, the driver. And by golly, traffic flows more smoothly when everyone uses GridGuide and you can do other things while you drive, so it's great. Of course, GridGuide only works where the corps want it to work, which is fine for corporate drones on their daily commutes, but no good at all if you need to go into the barrens or a not-generally-open-to-the-public industri- al area. And even if you're in approved areas, GridGuide doesn't respond well to emergencies, like evasive ma- neuvers or quick getaways. In fact, if you try to do any- thing GridGuide doesn't think is wise or safe, the system is going to drag you down. (But doesn't it always?) If you ever intend to go off the beaten path, or to maybe do something out of the ordinary, you're going to need to learn how to drive, and you need to have a vehicle that does not depend on the power of the grid.

   If you're traveling from city to city or country to coun- try, you can rely on your personal vehicle, but there are other modes of transportation available. Trains and bus- es are available in most sprawls, and they can take you from sprawl to sprawl. The security in intra-city transit is pretty light; if you have the nuyen, you can ride. You may need to pass through security, and your SIN will be checked for longer trips, but on trains the scanners are cheap and easily fooled. Plus, you get to ride a bullet train, which tends to be awesome. If they remembered to clean it.
   If you opt for air travel, you've got three choices: reg- ular, suborbital, and semiballistic.
   Semiballistic is the fastest and the most expensive; it can get you from Europe to North America in less than an hour, and you'll pay through the nose for the privilege. Security is tight. SIN scanners are top-of-the- line and nearly impossible to fool. All weapons will be checked (don't even think about explosives), and all cy- berware must be deactivated.
   Sub-orbitals are slightly slower, slightly cheaper, and slightly easier to infiltrate. Slightly. Sub-orbital passen- gers are usually megacorporate clients, and the corps want them to feel safe. Security is tight, and violations will be dealt with harshly.
   Regular air travel is for regular people. Security is present, but quality varies from provider to provider; if your fake SIN and forged documentation are good enough, you should do fine.
   Of course, if you want to avoid public transportation altogether, there are ways to get around. Hitch a ride in the back of a cargo van, or in a container ship, or as part of a drone convoy. And then there's the almighty t-bird, the favorite choice of smugglers, spies, and anyone else involved in illicit border crossings. There are several different types of t-birds, but they have a few common characteristics: they're small, maneuverable, capable of landing in tight spots, and able to fly low to avoid ra- dar. Learn how to pilot one of these babies well, and you'll never lack for work. Or anti-aircraft fire from folks you've pissed off.

 THE REST OF LIFE 
PAYING YOUR WAY 
If you live in a civilized part of the world, you likely have not ever held actual cash in your hand. Money is trans- ferred between bank accounts (usually in the form of nuyen, which is the world's leading currency) to settle debts; on those occasions when people want to severely limit access to their accounts, they use credsticks, small




pieces of plastic with a specified amount of nuyen en- coded on them. That's how you pay for things; if you use cash, you're either in some backwater part of the world without Matrix access, or you're a time traveler from the distant past.
   While the nuyen is the most common currency in the world, some nations have their own currency, though they generally use the nuyen alongside it. Larger corporations, including the Big Ten, also have their own corporate scrip, which can only be used in their hold- ings. Corps love paying in scrip, as it means the mon- ey they put out will eventually come back to them, but shadowrunners hate it, as no one wants their spending options limited.

ENTERTAINMENT 
The Matrix is a lot of things, but to most of the general populace, it's the greatest anti-boredom measure ever developed. The vast amounts of trideo streams, music, games, and what-not available on the Matrix could dis- tract any individual for several lifetimes. Comedies like the Cree & Dido series, fantasy adventure like Neil the Ork Barbarian, action like the Water Margin series, clas- sic music from Concrete Dreams and Maria Mercurial, new music from Christy Daee and CrimeTime-all that is out there, and more. There is a constant war between corporations trying to find ways to wring more money out of the Matrix and consumers trying to get as much as they can for free. With the new, more controlled Ma- trix, the corps have gotten the upper hand in this battle, but there is still enough free or low-cost entertainment to keep the public sufficiently anesthetized.

FOOD 
Soy. The food scene is about soy. The different textures and tastes it can be given have turned out to be quite wide-ranging, which is good, because soy is all most of us can afford. Actual meat is an expensive luxury, so when the masses need something that has both texture and pro- tein, we eat soy. It's omnipresent, even in our pick-me-up beverages, as soykaf is much more commonly available than genuine coffee. It's not bad, especially since most of us have never experienced the real alternative.

RULES OF THE STREET



Gameplay in Shadowrun: Anarchy revolves around two things (besides leaping into bad craziness for a handful of nuyen, which in Shadowrun is a given): Building the Sto- ry and Rolling Dice. But first, let's talk about some of the important things you'll need to be ready for the game.
   Note: For ease of reference, important terms will be bolded when they are first detailed to make them easy to find. Additionally, the rules may reference the "Cue Sys- tem." This is a general name for this unique rules system, while "Shadowrun: Anarchy" or "Anarchy" represents this entire volume, meaning the Cue System rules with the Shadowrun: Anarchy twist, or liquid Shadowrun: Anarchy poured over the rocks of the Cue System. Choose which- ever drink-based analogy suits you.

DICE 
As noted in the Introduction, Shadowrun: Anarchy uses six-sided dice; anytime "D" is used, as in "D6," it's short- hand for "die" or "dice," so 4D6 means 4 six-sided dice. Rolled dice are scored individually instead of being add- ed together. Shadowrun: Anarchy, like regular Shadowrun, uses six-sided dice pretty much exclusively.

 BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS 
Here are some of the basic things, besides dice, that you will need to make a game of Shadowrun: Anarchy work.

CHOOSE OR CREATE A CHARACTER 
Each Character Sheet (starting on p. 74) consists of an illustration and all the pertinent information for a Shad- owrun: Anarchy character. To make sure you choose a character you'll like, you'll have to understand the dif- ferent parts of a sheet. For an in-depth look at Character Sheets, see p. 29.

NOTE 
Players can easily grab a character sheet and leap into action based on the name of a character, their Tags and Cues, or even just the artwork. But it can help to know how the game is going to work, and what you are going to be wielding when it's time to throw down. If you want that info, check out the Rolling Dice portion of this sec- tion (p. 37) before selecting their character sheets.

DESIGNATE A GAMEMASTER 
In most tabletop roleplaying games, there is someone in charge-in this game, it's a gamemaster (GM). This per- son acts as the mastermind behind the game, creating the plots and stories the players will interact with.
   The GM is in charge of establishing the setting and running the game world the players interact with, but they do not have the sole responsibility for introducing story elements and moving them forward. In Shadow- run: Anarchy, storytelling is a shared experience. Players apply their creativity to a variety of story elements, not just their characters' actions. They work with the GM

to build something entertaining and fun for everyone involved. This means that the GM's job is more about facilitating the story-keeping it moving and giving the players what they need to make the story fun-than it is about controlling it. See Building the Story on p. 35 for more information on how this works.

SELECT A CONTRACT BRIEF 
On the mean streets of the Sixth World, there's no such thing as a typical shadowrun. Whether a Mr. Johnson sends you to steal a prototype, deal with freedom fight- ers in a bush war, guard (or geek) a VIP, or any number of other odd jobs, the possibilities of what your team will end up doing is endless. Flip through the Happening World section (see p. 153) and you can check out a huge variety of possibilities, jobs from cities or small towns that range from action-oriented combat to stealthy in- trigue, and more. Pick your poison, and there's a vial ready to drink down at the gaming table.
   Contract Briefs supply all the information you need to start playing, quick and easy. Each Contract Brief in- cludes many points that players can use to play the job, and multiple Contract Briefs can be connected to make a Campaign (see p. 153). Here are some of the sections that will generally be found in the briefs.
• 
Context: A short overview of what the Contract Brief will be about, what the goal will be,
and what opposition the characters can expect to find. This often is presented as in- universe text, something a character in the game universe might come across and read. These can be military documents, historical texts, security briefs, intercepted personal communications, local newspapers, and so on. This section is intended to help the GM establish some background for the story and establish the right feel.
• Mr. Johnson's Pitch: This section represents the team's meet with the Mr. Johnson who is contracting the shadowrunners' services, and
it is usually read aloud to the group to kick off the Mission.
• Objectives: The Objectives list a set of goals or accomplishments that characters are expected to do, though they aren't mandatory-plots may twist, turn, and take runners in strange places.
• Tags: Tags give short descriptions of the Contract Brief to give players the gist of the adventure- for example, when trying to skim and find a specific flavor for a contract to run-or to aid the creation of a longer campaign.


28	RULES OF THE STREET




• The Setting: The Setting is a description of the area where the characters find themselves at the beginning of the Contract Brief. The GM can read this aloud to players at the beginning of the job.
• Enemies/Obstacles: Finally, the Enemies/ Obstacles section gives the opponents and obstacles that the characters may have to defeat or overcome to successfully complete the contract.
• Scenes: Each part of the job is considered a Scene, or section, of the overall Contract. For ease of use, each Scene includes suggested NPCs to use from the book. However, those are just suggestions. Use whatever NPCs your group thinks will make the job rattle and hum. Scenes may also offer special-case rules or GM advice for ways the players can tackle that particular Scene.

   Like pretty much every part of Shadowrun: Anarchy, lots of the information given in a Contract Brief is up to the discretion of the players. Want to add your own NPCs? Go for it! Want to change parts of the Scene? No problem! Want to change the Objectives? No one's stop- ping you! Raise the fun factor high, keep the plot mov- ing, and you're golden.

LOCK AND LOAD! 
Once you've chosen characters, a GM, and Contract Brief, grab some dice and jump into the action.

 CHARACTER SHEET 
Your character sheet contains all of the information you'll need to tackle any problem, be it physical, mag- ical, or virtual.

ILLUSTRATION/PERSONAL DATA 
The character sheet includes an illustration of the char- acter, along with Personal Data-name, metatype, age, that sort of thing. This section also includes a set of one- word Tags that immediately provide an at-a-glance grasp of what defines this character.
   This section also includes a brief character descrip- tion and some Dispositions, which are easy-to-review sentences that make a character who and what they are. This information, along with the Cues and Qualities on the second page, provides everything the player needs

to quickly get inside the head of their character and leap into the action. As a quick guide, Dispositions cover a character's motivations and rules of conduct, Cues cover things they might say, and Qualities cover some aspects of themselves that make them especially good at some things, less good at others.

ATTRIBUTES AND ATTRIBUTE DICE 
Beginning at the top of the second page of the character sheet, you'll see the different Attributes and the num- ber of dice that represent those stats (Attribute Dice).
   Strength: It's how strong you are. Duh. Also rep- resents your constitution, a measure of your physical health and resiliency. Strength determines your Physi- cal Condition Monitor-the amount of damage you can absorb-as well as the amount of damage you inflict in close combat, so if you plan on punching a lot, this helps you punch harder.
   Agility: It's not just about power-it's how you use it. Agility is a combination of hand-eye coordination, flex- ibility, balance, and reaction-reflexes and awareness of situations. This Attribute covers how good a person is in combat, whether ranged, close quarters, hand-to-hand, or even vehicle-to-vehicle.
   Willpower: When you're slogging through a muddy ruined building in the barrens while acid rain is dissolv- ing your coat, do you plug along or go home and make some nice, hot tea? Willpower helps determine the an- swer. It's a combination of your character's desire to push through adversity under any condition and that gut-instinct voice that anticipates an ambush or tells you when it's time to cut and run. Willpower determines how many boxes are in your Stun Condition Monitor, which measures the amount of punches (and other such damage) you can take before sagging to the grind in blank, unconscious submission
   Logic: This corresponds to the mental faculties of the character, whether street smarts, learned science, or just plain inherent brilliance. Helps you quickly come up with an answer to the ever-present question, "If you're so smart, why are you still on the streets?"
   Charisma: You don't need to out-shoot someone if you can talk them out of pulling on you. Charisma is your character's ability to talk their way out of a situation- your presence as you walk into a room and take charge.
   Essence: In a technological world dominated by the need to be faster and stronger to survive, many people willingly carve away pieces of their metahumanity to stay one step ahead of the bullet with their name on it. Essence is a measure of how much of a character's meta- humanity remains. See Essence Loss on page 33 for more information.


RULES OF THE STREET	29



   Edge: Edge is a very special number for each char- acter. Unlike the other Attributes, it does not corre- spond to a number of dice, but instead it can be spent to gain some much-needed help for a particularly dif- ficult roll (see The Core Mechanic, p. 37). Edge only replenishes at the beginning of each game session, so spend it wisely.

SKILLS 
Skills represent the knowledge and abilities a character has developed while running the shadows. Skills cover a wide variety of topics, from the ability to shoot a gun, hack a Matrix system, or keep a teammate from bleeding out. Skills work hand in hand with Attributes when de- termining how many dice to roll for a given Test.
Skills are covered in detail on page 31.

SHADOW AMPS 
The Shadowrun universe is a dystopian future where man meets magic and machine. From casting spells to augmenting physical attributes via magic to cyber- ware and bioware enhancing bones, flesh, and muscle, to chips that allow for bare-brained interactions with the worldwide Matrix, to complex forms used by tech- nomancers, a myriad of ways exist to augment flesh and blood. Shadow Amps (short for Shadow Ampli- fications, often shortened further to simply "Amps") represent those more-human-than-human improve- ments and advantages, and they are covered in detail on page 32.

KARMA 
In the Sixth World, what goes around comes around. Karma is a measure of the experience and resources your character has accumulated, for good or for other- wise, and it is used for improving your character (see Character Advancement, p. 70). A space is provided on the character sheet to keep track of how much Karma your character has earned.

CUES 
In the center of the sheet are the character's Cues. Cues are statements or quotes that help define the character, whether it's attitude, capabilities, or person- ality. Each Cue can help form the basis of a Narration (see p. 34).



QUALITIES 
Below the Cues are Qualities, which round out your char- acter's personality and affect certain actions. These often are built off of a character's Disposition, providing con- crete rules for how a character will react in various circum- stances, whereas Tags define what your character is.
   Each character has three Qualities-two positive and one negative.

WEAPONS 
Most shadowrunners who plan to stay alive carry at least one weapon. The Weapons section lists these tools of the trade, the damage they inflict on a successful hit, and their range. In many instances, additional rules are included for the effects of the weapon.
Weapons are covered in more detail on p. 40.

ARMOR 
The Armor track gives the number of Armor dots the character has. Armor is a generic term that covers things like a Kevlar jacket, military-grade body armor, an Ar- mor spell, and extreme agility. Anything that might keep someone from being hit by an attack is in this category. If a Skill or Amp provides a permanent Armor boost (as opposed to, say, an Armor spell that must be cast), it
will be reflected in the Skill or Amp's text.
   Armor helps absorb damage during combat (see p. 40).

CONDITION MONITOR 
The Condition Monitor track defines the character's health status. Once a character's Armor (or any spell or Shadow Amp that acts as Armor) has been depleted by damage, further damage will accumulate on the appro- priate part of the Condition Monitor.
   There are two different types of damage, Physical and Stun, which are tracked separately. Different weapons and effects can either be Physical or Stun damage.
   As injuries pile up, a character will suffer negative performance effects (see Dice Pools, p. 37).

GEAR 
While a good shadowrunner trusts her abilities, she also carries some tools and supplies, which are listed in the Gear column of the character sheet. Unlike weapons, gear in Shadowrun: Anarchy has no set stats. Take a stim- patch, for example. Sure, it could just be a standard pain-



30	RULES OF THE STREET




killer. But what if right in the middle of an escape, the GM drops a Plot Point to say that the stimpatch a sha- man slaps on to overcome some wounds is from a bad batch laced with a custom-tailored street drug? What might happen?
   In such instances, the player may have to answer those questions during gameplay with a clever Narration (see p. 34).
Gear generally falls into two categories:
   Noncombat Gear: This is stuff that's (generally) not for killing people. What will Coydog use her shamanic lodge materials for? Does she have anything personal on her Meta Link commlink, or is it just a cheap burner unit? Contacts: As the saying goes, "You are who you know," and your contacts can mean the difference be- tween life and death in the shadows. The variety of contacts can help inspire unique approaches to other- wise sticky situations. Who is Coydog's contact Granny Smith? What's her deal? How could she help the team solve the problem at hand? Answering these sorts of
questions can make for a great story.

NPC CHARACTER SHEET 
   Finally, there are two types of character sheets: those for fleshed-out player characters, and those for less-im- portant individuals, like henchmen or supporting characters, or even for certain types of gear with their own damage tracks and weapons, such as vehicles and drones. These non-player character (NPC) sheets take up a third of a page and contain much less information than player character sheets. Gamemasters can also modify the NPCs in the Street People section (see p. 73) to expand the number of enemies for a given contract.

 SKILLS 
Each character has a unique set of Skills that showcase the actions that character excels in. Every Skill has two parts: a dice value and the specific Attribute the Skill is linked to. Whenever a player uses that particular Skill to accomplish an action, the value of the Skill is added to the linked Attribute to determine the base number of dice rolled. See Rolling Dice, p. 37, for more information on using Skills.
   The name and description of each Skill (see Skills List, p. 32) provides a guideline for some ideas for what the Skill can do, but ultimately it'll be up to the play- er, the GM, and the roleplaying group to determine the limits of what each Skill can accomplish. Most Skills are broad enough to cover several different options for an action, such as the Hacking Skill, which can be used


























to brute-force your way into a Matrix node, set a data bomb, engage in cybercombat with IC or spiders, and so on. If a player wants a given Skill to do something that might fall slightly outside the guidelines of that Skill and there is no other specific Skill in the Skills List that would govern the action, the GM may allow the action, generally allowing the player to simply roll the value of the Attribute normally linked to the Skill (magical skills are the exception to this rule).

SPECIALIZATIONS 
Some Skills contain additional text in that Skill's box. These represent Specializations, meaning the character has further honed their proficiency in that Skill in a spe- cific direction of focus, such as a particular weapon or a certain area of study. Specializations generally allow the player to gain extra dice when using that Skill in a Test. However, if the conditions of the Specialization are not met, you receive no bonus dice for the Test.
   For example, on Shades' character sheet (see p. 121), the Specialization text on the Pistols Skill is "Pistols +2." This means that when Shades uses her Firearms Skill to fire a pistol, she receives two additional dice for the Test. However, when she's shooting any other type of gun, she won't roll the bonus Specialization dice.


RULES OF THE STREET	31


SKILLS LIST 
The following list shows which Attributes link to which Skills, and provides some examples of what kinds of actions each Skill can accomplish. For quick reference, each Skill on a character sheet shows a letter denoting the linked Attribute.

STRENGTH
Though Strength is not linked to any Skills, this Attri- bute determines the Physical track on the Condition Monitor (see Damage, Armor, and the Condition Moni- tor, p. 42), and it increases the damage of Close Combat actions (see Combat, p. 40).

AGILITY
   Athletics: Running, jumping, swimming, and acro- batics.
   Close Combat: Armed melee combat, unarmed me- lee combat, and martial arts.
   Projectile Weapons: Bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, and certain critter attacks.
Firearms: Pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and rifles.
   Heavy Weapons: Machine guns, assault cannons, missile launchers, and grenade launchers.
   Vehicle	Weapons:	Vehicle-mounted	weapons, drone-mounted weapons, and pintle mounts.
Stealth: Sneaking, palming, and pickpocketing.
Piloting (Ground): Cars, trucks, bikes, even tanks.
Wheeled and tracked drones too.
   Piloting (Other): Boats, planes, and pretty much any- thing that moves on something besides ground.
   Escape Artist: Escaping bindings, contortionism, and shaking a tail.

WILLPOWER
   Conjuring: Summoning and banishing spirits. Magi- cians only. Cannot use untrained.
   Sorcery: Spellcasting, ritual spellcasting, enchant- ing, and counterspelling. Magicians only. Cannot use untrained.
   Astral Combat: Astral/spirit combat. Astral plane only. Magicians only.
Survival: Wilderness survival, navigation, and fasting.
Close Combat: When attacking spirits only.


LOGIC
Biotech: First aid, medicine, and cybertechnology.
Hacking: Computer hacking and cybercombat.




   Electronics: Computer hardware and software, cy- berdeck repair.
   Engineering: Auto repair, aircraft repair, and boat repair. Tasking: Summoning sprites, threading complex forms, and other Matrix tasks. Technomancers only.
Cannot use untrained.
   Tracking: Physical tracking, Matrix tracking, and shadowing.
   Knowledge Skills: Languages, interests knowledge, and professional knowledge.

CHARISMA
Con: Con artistry, acting, performance, and etiquette. Intimidation: Influence, interrogation, and torture. Negotiation: Bargaining, contracts, and diplomacy.
   Disguise: Camouflage, cosmetics, costuming, and digital alteration.

 SHADOW AMPS 
Shadow Amps (or just Amps) is a catchall term for cer- tain advantages, spells, and modifications that can ben- efit a character. Amps is an umbrella term covering a huge swath of possibilities. From spells players can sling at opponents, to body modifications that make a charac- ter stronger or capable of sustaining damage, to implants that make a character smarter-almost anything is pos- sible, if you're willing to pay the price.
   Much like how Skills supplement Attributes, Amps also enhance related actions by granting certain effects. For example, one Shadow Amp might allow rerolls of cer- tain dice that failed to score a hit, another might grant a bonus die in certain situations, and another might act like a Cue to a Narration instead of enhancing a die roll, and so on. Amp effects are listed on the character sheet. See Rolling Dice (p. 37) for more information on how Amps can factor into gameplay.

TYPES 
Shadow Amps come in several different types. Here are a few examples of each type:
   Spells: Magicians can manipulate mana to cast spells. Characters must be Awakened (see p. 63) to cast spells.
   The Invisibility Spell allows the player to reroll one die that failed to score a hit on their Stealth Test, and the Improved Invisibility Spell allows two failed dice to be rerolled.
   Telesma: Enchanted magical items can impart spe- cial bonuses when bound to a magician.
A weapon focus is an imbued melee weapon that

can be used in astral combat, and a low-grade spirit focus allows the reroll of one die on a failed Conjur- ing Test.
   Adept Powers: Instead of casting spells, adepts use mana to perform physical magic.
   The Killing Hands adept power allows the player to deal Physical damage instead of Stun damage when us- ing the Unarmed weapon in a Close Combat roll, and the Missile Parry power allows the character to pluck arrows or knives out of the air by negating one hit when target- ed by a Projectile Weapons attack.
   Cyberware: Cyberware represents technological im- plants in the body.
   Wired reflexes 1 gives the player 1 extra attack action per Narration (see Attack Limits, p. 40). Wired reflexes 2 gives 1 extra attack per Narration and 1 Plot Point (see Plot Points, p. 35) at the beginning of each Scene.
   Bioware: Bioware represents biological implants and genetically engineered improvements on the metahu- man body.
   Tailored pheromones allow the character to influence others. Rating 1 allows the reroll of one failed die on any Charisma-related Test, whereas Rating 3 rerolls 3 dice.
   Cyberdecks: Unless you're a technomancer, you'll need some hardware to hack into the Matrix. Cyber- decks are what you need.
A cheap cyberdeck like an Erika MCD-1 will allow the

reroll of one failed die on a Hacking Test, but a high-end cyberdeck, like a Shiawase Cyber-5, will allow three failed dice to be rerolled. Cyberdecks also have a Firewall rating and a Matrix Condition Monitor, which are both used in cybercombat (see Hacking and Cybercombat, p. 44).
Programs: If you want to be successful in the Ma-
trix, you'll need some (possibly illegal) programs to massage data.
   An Armor program reduces the amount of damage taken in cybercombat by 1, and a Biofeedback program lets you use neural feedback to damage a hostile decker's Condition Monitor instead of the cyberdeck's. See Hack- ing and Cybercombat, p. 44.
   Critter Powers: Some nonmetahuman NPCs have special abilities that can be used in Tests, combat rolls, and general Narrations.
   The spirit of earth's Concealment power lets it grant a +1 modifier, while a spirit of fire's Fear power inflicts a -1 modifier to opponents.

Many Shadow Amps, most notably cyberware and bio- ware implants, require the character to trade away part of their metahumanity, and this results in Essence loss. The more you push the boundaries of what your body can do, the more you lose your metahumanity in the process.


RULES OF THE STREET	33



   Not all Amps include an Essence loss, however. For example, many magical Amps do not diminish your Es- sence. If a Shadow Amp includes an Essence loss, it will be noted as such on that portion of the character sheet, e.g., "[Cyberarms: Essence -1]".
   If a character's Essence is low enough to incur any penalties, that fact is noted on the character sheet next to the Essence value. Low Essence imposes a dice-pool penalty on hits on magic- and healing-related Tests.

PLAYING SHADOWRUN:
 ANARCHY 
Once each player has some dice and a character sheet, a Contract Brief has been selected, and a GM chosen, your group is ready to get started.
   Shadowrun: Anarchy play is divided into a series of segments that build on each other: Turns and Narrations, Scenes, Missions, and Campaigns.

TURNS AND NARRATIONS 
Shadowrun: Anarchy gameplay is divided into a series of turns. Each turn, every player has a chance to play out and describe their character's actions, along with other elements of the story going on around them. These de- scriptions are called Narrations, and as the game pro- gresses these Narrations build on each other and form the story of the game.
   A Narration gives a player a chance to describe what their character does as well as add and describe other story elements. Other players may have things to say during a Narration-their characters may react some- how, or players may offer commentary, ideas, or obser- vations-but the primary thrust of the Narration should be directed by the player whose turn it is. The Narration usually only covers a few minutes of out-of-game time (and probably less in-game time) before moving to the next player, to keep things flowing quickly and giving everyone a chance to stay involved in the ongoing sto- ry. In combat, a Narration will typically last as long as it takes to execute a single Combat Action (see p. 40); in non-combat activities, the length of the Narration might be more variable. The general guideline is for it to last as long as the game needs to stay lively and keep everyone involved.

GAMEMASTER 
Each turn begins with the GM and continues with the player on the GM's left until all players have had a turn




at Narration (though check the Talk Time sidebar and Spending Plot Points: Gamemaster, p. 36, for some ex- ceptions to this).
   The GM begins the turn by giving a narrative of the current situation and advancing the plot, as described un- der Select a Contract Brief (see p. 28). The GM also makes any actions or die rolls for enemies the characters may en- counter.
   Once all players have had a chance to narrate their character's actions, the turn ends and a new turn begins.


SCENE 
A Scene is defined as the start and finish of a given sec- tion of time within a Contract Brief. A Scene contains a number of turns, which vary depending upon what's occurring within a given Scene.
   For example, take a look at Be Careful What You Search For (see p. 154). Each of the three descriptions of the Enemies/Obstacles found in that Event Brief is a Scene. There is no hard and fast rule on how many turns are in a Scene. Instead, that will be based on how many play- ers are involved, their style of play, and their Narrations, which ultimately leads to how quickly (or slowly) they're able to accomplish the goals of a given Scene.

CONTRACT BRIEF 
A Contract Brief usually constitutes a single game ses- sion, and the session ends when all of the Scenes within a Contract Brief are completed. The number of Scenes required to finish an Event Brief is detailed in each Event Brief, but this can be modified by the player group.


34	RULES OF THE STREET




   For example, one player group may decide after ac- complishing the three Scenes laid out in Be Careful What You Search For that the Event Brief is done, and their time running the shadows is over for the day. However, another group playing the same Contract Brief might decide to add in a new fourth Scene that helps close up some of the plot threads that grew through players' Narrations, so they keep playing. A third group might not have as long to play as the other groups, so they actually split the Event Brief up into two different days of gaming sessions. Whatever works for each playing group is just fine.

BUILDING THE STORY: NARRATION AND FLOW 
Giving a Narration is quite easy. All a player has to do is describe what his or her character is doing, such as engaging in a firefight, exploring a Matrix host, or sum- moning a spirit, as well as adding some descriptions about what happens around them when they do what they do.
   If any action has a chance of failure, then a dice-roll- ing test is made to determine whether the action suc- ceeds. See Rolling Dice, p. 37.
   Many Narrations are based on Cues provided on character sheets or Mission Briefs.

CUES 
Cues are building blocks players can use as a basis for Narrations. Cues are both suggestions and descriptions. They can be positive and negative and never have to be narrated the same way twice. If a player draws a blank or wants to make sure he's staying on-topic, he can look at a list of Cues and choose an appropriate one to base a Narration around.

MOVING THE STORY FORWARD 
Collaborative narration is about creating a story and moving it forward. Shadowrun: Anarchy is about mak- ing impossible choices, facing terrifying challenges, and overcoming them in fantastic and fun ways. It is all about saying "yes" to fun, not "no" to something un- expected.
   So when you are faced with the impossible, you smile and say, "Yes, and ..." Then you make it up! There is no wrong way in Shadowrun: Anarchy. Want to have the characters swallowed by a magical alchera while running the shadows of Los Angeles? Then do it! But be ready for

the GM to have a metaplanar entity show up and try to force you out. After all, the rule is "Yes, and ..." Respect other players' choices, don't use your Narrative to make an overly easy way out or an impossible challenge, and you'll be building a fun story.

PLOT POINTS 
The most exciting plots include twists you never saw coming-a twisted water spirit emerging from a swamp, experimental security countermeasures appearing right in the middle of your firefight, a strange subsystem in a Matrix node that gets activated, or a vicious paracritter breaks free from its laboratory cage.
   In gameplay, these twists can come about through Plot Points, which can be employed in many ways. They are used to interrupt or alter another player's Narra- tion-a method of adding a twist to the game. They can also be used to change player turn order, add a glitch die, or gain back a point of Physical or Stun damage. The ways players utilize Plot Points are only limited by how creative they want to be.
   Players will be earning and spending Plot Points throughout the game, and using some type of tokens (such as poker chips or pennies) is the best method to track them. However, players are free to use whatever system works best, whether it's chips, dice, noting them down on paper, tablet, or smartphone, and so on.

EARNING PLOT POINTS: PLAYERS
Players begin the game with three Plot Points each and may be awarded more points by the GM for particular- ly good Narrations. Players may have a maximum of five Plot Points at any time, and only one point may be awarded to a player at a time. Certain Shadow Amps give players a bonus Plot Point at the start of combat.
   The GM is the only person who may award Plot Points, though some Shadow Amps tell them when this should happen.

EARNING PLOT POINTS: GAMEMASTER
The GM also receives Plot Points into a pool of their own. The GM starts a Contract Brief with one Plot Point, and every time a player spends a Plot Point (see below), the GM receives that point.
   Unlike the players, the GM has no limit on how many Plot Points they can have.

SPENDING PLOT POINTS: PLAYERS
No matter what effect you want to cause, the cost is one Plot Point, and the change is immediately made to the


RULES OF THE STREET	35




























game. Players may not spend more than one point at a time in an attempt to maximize the twist, though they can spend multiple Plot Points during any player's Nar- ration (whether their own, or another player's).
Example things to do with Plot Points:
• Live dangerously: Add a Glitch Die to a player's roll, including your own (see The Glitch Die, p. 39).
• Shake it up: Change turn order by making a Narration and taking actions when it isn't your normal turn.
• Double time it: Take two movement actions to close on-or get away from-an opponent (See Character Movement, p. 42).
• Surprise threat: Unseen corporate security guards show up!
• First aid: Heal a point of Physical or Stun damage
• Malfunction: A character's spirits/devices/etc. suddenly stop working for a short period of time.
• Take the hit: If a weaker or injured character is successfully hit by a combat action-i.e., the target rolled fewer hits than the attacker- then a player can spend a Plot Point to take the hit instead. The original target's defense roll is ignored, and the interrupting player





























rolls their own defense dice against the attacker's hits.
• A dish best served cold: Immediately take one free attack action against the NPC who just attacked you. This attack does not count as a Narration.

   If you come up with another creative use for Plot Points, go for it! Plot Points are meant to change the game in fun and interesting ways, so don't be afraid to use your imagination.
   Just remember, Plot Point use doesn't always mean a positive change. Often plot twists are a negative event- something goes wrong that must be fixed or adapted to by the characters.

SPENDING PLOT POINTS: GAMEMASTER
Like players, the GM can spend Plot Points in any fash- ion they choose, with the following caveats:
• With the exception of adding a Glitch Die (see p. 39), Plot Points can only be spent to aid NPCs or create plot twists; they cannot be spent to directly aid or hinder a player.
• The GM can only spend one Plot Point per turn, unlike the players who can spend more than one per turn.


36	RULES OF THE STREET




• Instead of using a Plot Point to go first, the gamemaster can spend one to change how turn order works for a round. They can select to go in reverse order (starting with the player to the GM's right), or they can roll a die to randomly determine a new starting player for that round. This can be especially useful to shake up patterns players develop in a game or keep players on their toes.

TROUBLESHOOTING 
In an improv-style game such as Shadowrun: Anarchy, the single greatest issue that can suck the life and en- ergy out of a gaming session is if players start spending too much time deliberating over their actions and Nar- rations. If you've ever watched an improv play, when a character pauses too long trying to follow up with what's just been said, you're thrown out of the action and the energy is gone.
   If this starts to occur, players should work together as a group to help a player feel more at ease with this style of play. This could be practice sessions outside of a game, or something as simple as finding an enjoyable improv play to watch that can provide an example of how this style can unfold. Gamemasters can also do a lot to help by asking specific questions (e.g., "What are you going to tell that ork who's making a series of exceptionally rude gestures?" rather than a basic "What happens next?") and by making sure turns keep moving at a good clip, so that players do not struggle too much with making the story move forward. Don't force players to come up with something if they are blanking on ideas, or make them feel too much pressure. Keep it light, keep turns moving, and keep it fun! The Controlling Anarchy chapter (p. 55) has more advice on how to keep the game moving.

ROLLING DICE 
At some point, characters are going to attempt some- thing difficult, awesome, or nearly impossible, because those are the sorts of things characters are supposed to do. At those points, it's time to roll the dice, so here's info on how many to roll and what kind of numbers you want to see.

HITS
The main goal when making any die roll is to score hits. When rolling dice, any die that comes up as a five or six are counted as hits. When you spend a point of Edge, dice that roll a four, five, or six are counted as hits.

THE CORE MECHANIC 
Shadowrun: Anarchy uses a simple dice-rolling mechanic to resolve Tests and Combat.
   Any time your character (or an acting NPC) wish- es to perform an action where the success is in doubt, you need to make a Test to see whether the action was successful. Your main job is to figure out how many dice you are going to roll, then roll them and count up hits. The gamemaster decides on a difficulty for the roll and rolls an opposing dice pool, or rolls an opposing dice pool generated by an NPC. After making your roll, apply any Shadow Amp effects (if any), count up your final number of hits, and compare them to the number of hits rolled by the opposing dice. If your hits equal or exceed the hits scored by the opposing dice, then your action was suc- cessful. If you score zero hits, the Test automatically fails, even if the opposing dice also rolled zero hits.
This means that the mechanic for resolving all Tests
looks like this:

 Skill Dice + Attribute Dice + Modifiers (if any) + Shadow Amps effect (if any) vs. Opposing Dice

DICE POOLS
These are the elements that go into deciding how many dice you're going to roll:
   Skill Dice: If you possess a relevant Skill for the ac- tion, then your Skill dice form the base of your dice pool. If you have a Specialization for that Skill, and the Spe- cialization applies for the current action, then you also add the bonus dice as noted on the Skill.
   Attribute Dice: The Skill used to perform an action denotes the Skill's linked Attribute with a letter. Find the appropriate Attribute and add that Attribute's dice to the dice pool. A list of Skills and their related Attributes can be found on p. 32.
   Modifiers: Modifiers represent good or bad situa- tional circumstances that take an ordinary situation and make it extraordinary. Such as: you're trying to hack into a keypad while being attacked (a negative modifier), you're wounded (a negative modifier), and you're getting additional help (this also could be a positive or negative modifier depending upon the Logic value of the player trying to help). Some negative modifiers are clearly set out by the rules, such as:
• Injuries: The more damage on your Condition Monitor, the higher the modifier will be. See Damage, Armor, and the Condition Monitor, p. 42.
• Essence Loss: The lower your Essence, the more negative modifiers are applied to certain Tests.


RULES OF THE STREET	37



See Essence Loss, p. 33.
• Qualities: Positive and negative Qualities can affect certain actions by adding or subtracting dice from a roll. Check your character sheet to see if any of these apply.
• Assistance: Sometimes you just can't do it alone. These modifiers represent being helped by a teammate, a spirit, a Matrix sprite, or some other form of aid. See Teamwork Tests, p. 39.

   Beyond that, the gamemaster might impose addi- tional modifiers based in variable conditions. These modifiers (alone, not counted with the modifiers listed above) should never go beyond +5 or -5, and the highest (or lowest) level should apply only very rarely.
• Environment: Light, darkness, weather. This can also include things like the ground on which people are operating, surfaces they are trying to climb, and so on.
• Attitude: Social situations may be affected by the attitude of the non-player character, the overall situation, and the existing relationship with player characters.
• Distractions: Characters may be trying to drive and shoot at the same time, or fight while sustaining a spell, and the effort of doing multiple things makes them less effective performing at least one of them, so they take a penalty due to the distraction.

   Shadow Amp Effects: The text on a Shadow Amp will note whether it can affect the outcome of a Test, such as allowing the reroll of dice that failed to score a hit or reducing the number of opposing dice rolled, ne- gating hits, adding pips to dice (that is, making the roll one number higher), and so on. Make sure to apply a relevant effect before comparing hits with the opposing dice. Only one Shadow Amp can affect a roll's outcome; if two or more could apply to the Test, you must choose one effect to apply. See Shadow Amps, p. 32.
   Opposing Dice: In some cases, the opposing dice are determined by making dice pools of an opposing player. For example, if a non-player character is being attacked, they will roll a defensive test of Agility + Logic, just like a player character.
   In other circumstances, there will not be an oppos- ing dice pool from another person (like when a player character is trying to climb a wall). In those cases, the number of opposing dice that are rolled depends on the difficulty of the action:
• Very Easy: 4 dice
• Easy: 6 dice




• Average: 8 dice
• Hard: 10 dice
• Very Hard: 12 dice

   Different circumstances generally dictate a certain difficulty level. For example, a maglock at a securing the back door of a mom-and-pop store would likely fall into Very Easy difficulty (rolling only 4 dice against the play- er's dice pool), but a maglock in an ultra-secure Mitsu- hama Zero Zone would certainly be Very Hard (12 dice). If the difficulty is not readily apparent or there is too much deliberation over the difficulty, the gamemaster can never go wrong with Average difficulty.

ATTRIBUTE TESTS 
There are two types of occasions when you might ex- clude Skill dice from a Test and only roll Attribute dice.
   Untrained: If you want to try a specific action but are untrained in that action-i.e., the appropriate Skill is not on your character sheet-then determine what the linked Attribute is for the missing Skill (see Skills List, p. 32), and then use that Attribute's dice for the Test. In a few limited circumstances, such as Magic-based actions, Untrained actions cannot be taken. If a Skill cannot be used untrained, that is noted on the Skills list.
   Attribute-Only Tests: Some Tests only apply to a specific Attribute and don't need a related Skill. In those cases, either add two Attributes together, or add one At- tribute to itself. For example, lifting a heavy object would require a Strength + Strength Test; catching a thrown object would require Agility + Agility; resisting torture, Willpower + Body; remembering a specific detail, Logic + Logic; judging someone's intentions, Charisma + Charis- ma; and so on. One of the most common Tests of this na- ture is Perception, which is Logic + Willpower; for more information on Perception, see below. Shadow Amp ef- fects apply to Attribute-only Tests when appropriate.

PERCEPTION
As noted above, Perception Tests are made with Logic
+ Willpower. When a character is looking at inanimate objects, the opposing roll is based on the gamemaster's idea of the difficulty of the roll, per the listing for Oppos- ing Dice on this page. If the character succeeds at such a Perception Test, rather than simply tell the character what they see, give the player a chance to detail what it is they discover, as this can bring the player into the fun of shaping the story.
   If a character is trying to see a sapient being that may be trying to sneak past them, the Perception Test gener- ally would be opposed by Stealth + Agility of whatever


38	RULES OF THE STREET




the character is trying to see. In this case, the gamemas- ter should feel free to tell the character who or what they see if they are successful.

EDGE 
When you need a boost on a test, you can spend Edge in one of two ways. First, you can announce you're spending Edge before you roll a test; when you roll the dice, you get to add an extra die to the roll and count fours, fives, and sixes as hits, instead of just fives and sixes. Second, after you roll the dice, you can spend a point of Edge to re-roll all of the dice that were not fives and sixes. When spending Edge this way, you still only count fives and sixes as hits. If you want the benefit of having fours be hits, plan ahead! You can spend a number of Edge points in a single gam- ing session equal to your Edge rating. Once you've spent
them all, you're done using Edge until the next session.

TEAMWORK TESTS 
Good shadowrunning requires teamwork, and some- times that means pitching in as a team to get a single task done. When appropriate and sensible, players can help each other on a Test, making a Teamwork Test. A player can suggest a Teamwork Test on their Narra- tion, or other players can mention they would like to help. Making the assist rolls do not require any change in whose turn it is; players can make an assist roll even when it is not their Narration, but the leader must make a roll during their Narration.
   To assist, players choose a leader who will be doing the main work of a Test. The other players make the ap- propriate Skill Test. Any hits they make become addi- tional dice for the player taking the lead on the Test, to a maximum of the leader's Skill level (or the higher of the two Attributes, if it is an Attribute-only Test).
   Certain circumstances are not appropriate for assis- tance. Spellcasting, conjuring, and most combat tests cannot use Teamwork Tests. Gamemasters and players should use their judgment as to when other Teamwork Tests will be appropriate or not. Generally, characters need to be in the same place and able to function in a helpful way (meaning they are, you know, conscious and mobile) at a minimum.

THE GLITCH DIE: GLITCHES AND EXPLOITS 
Even when a shadowrun is going right, sometimes a quirk of chaos manages to worm its way in and make things go south really, really fast-or provide just the lucky break you needed. In Shadowrun: Anarchy, game-

masters and players can represent this manifestation of fate, or whatever you want to call it, by introducing the Glitch Die into a roll.
   To use the Glitch Die, the GM or a player must spend a Plot Point before a roll is made. The player spending the Plot Point gives the rolling player a die that is no- ticeably different from the other dice being rolled. This die can be a different color, style, or size-whichever the players prefer.

GLITCHES
If the Glitch Die comes up as a 1, then a Glitch has oc- curred, and the universe has once again attempted to screw you.
   In the event of a Glitch, the player who made the roll must detail their stroke of bad luck in their Narration of the attempted action they were rolling for. For exam- ple, a player who Glitches an unarmed Close Combat roll could miss a kick and fall; a Glitched Hacking Test could accidentally delete the wrong file; a Stealth Test could draw the attention of a corporate security hellhound; a Firearms action could jam the gun; and so on.
   A Glitch will still occur even if the Test itself is suc- cessful, thanks to the other dice rolled. For example, if you are trying to make a flying dive into cover and you succeed in a Gymnastics Test but roll a 1 on the Glitch Die, then maybe you dive for cover successfully but land wrong, jam your elbow on the ground, and take 1 point of Stun damage. Or maybe you Glitch on a successful Hacking Test: perhaps you grab the file you need, but you trip security in the process and alert some intrusion countermeasures. How the Glitch manifests is com- pletely up to the imagination.
   Regardless of how the Glitch occurs, it shouldn't be life threatening unless the affected player wishes it to be, for the sake of drama. Instead, a Glitch should repre- sent unforeseen complications that really throw a span- ner into the works. The best Glitches help move the sto- ry forward in new and interesting directions, so feel free to let your creative flag fly right in the face of bad luck.

EXPLOITS
If the Glitch Die rolls a 5 or a 6, then it counts as an Exploit. When an Exploit occurs, the player has made fate their plaything, and something went really right for a change. This windfall of good luck can take any form the gamemaster deems appropriate for the action taken, such as bypassing the target's armor during an combat action, stumbling on an incriminating Matrix file that you weren't looking for, an attacking spirit suddenly and
mysteriously backs down, and so on.


RULES OF THE STREET	39



   An Exploit can also occur if the roll failed. As long as the Glitch die rolled a hit, the Exploit reveals a silver lin- ing to your failed action. For example, a failed swerve to maneuver your Harley-Davidson Scorpion out of danger might distract one of the people you're chasing, or an accidentally tripped Matrix alarm might spontaneously reset itself due to a scheduled maintenance routine.
   As with Glitches, the best Exploits are those that in- ject some unexpected fun into your story.

COMBAT 
Combat is when the time comes to bash heads, shoot people in the face for money, or what have you. It works in similar fashion to other Tests. Regardless of whether the action is ranged, melee, magical, or otherwise, the attack is resolved the same way. The basic dice-rolling mechanic for all combat is:

    Skill Dice + Attribute Dice + Modifiers (if any) + Shadow Amp/Weapon Effects (if any) vs. Agility Dice + Logic Dice + Modifiers + Shadow Amp Effects (if any)

   As shown, combat is a straightforward contest be- tween the attacker's and defender's hits. If the attacker equals or exceeds the defender's hits, then the defend- er takes damage. The difference between the attacker' hits and defenders hits-called net hits-is added to the damage of the attack. If the attacker rolls fewer hits than the target, then the attack fails and inflicts no damage. If the attacker rolls zero hits, the attack automatically fails, even if the defender also rolled zero hits.

MODIFIERS
As with Test rolls, combat rolls can have a variety of situational modifiers added, all of which are decided upon by the GM. Certain spells, range penalties, and environmental effects are common modifiers seen in combat rolls.
   In addition to those listed on p. 37, here are common modifiers that apply to combat rolls:
• Weapon Dice: Some weapons offer bonus dice when used in combat rolls.
• Range: Certain ranges incur dice penalties. See Weapons on this page.

SHADOW AMP/WEAPON EFFECTS 
Some Shadow Amps can be used in combat, and some weapons have additional effects when used, such as al- lowing the reroll of dice that failed to score a hit or re- ducing the number of opposing dice rolled. Make sure




to apply a relevant effect before comparing hits with the opposing dice. Only the weapon used and one Amp can affect a roll's outcome; if two or more Amps could apply to the combat roll, you must choose which effect to ap- ply. See Shadow Amps, p. 32.
In combat rolls, if the defender possesses any Amps
that apply to defense, such as a type of reaction en- hancer or the physical adept power Missile Parry, then those effects get applied to the defender's roll before comparing hits.

ATTACK LIMITS 
A character can only take a single attack action during their Narration. What is an Attack action? An action that intentionally and directly damages another living being (including NPCs, critters, spirits, and whatever). Want to debate the meaning of Attack action beyond that? Have fun, and we'll be here for you when you're ready to play! Reaction Enhancers: The notable exceptions to this rule are the various types of reaction enhancers. For ex- ample, wired reflexes and the Increase Reflexes spell al- low characters to take a bonus attack action. See Seizing
the Initiative, p. 44.

WEAPONS 
Weapons come in all shapes, types, and sizes. You name it, and one of the megacorps undoubtedly sells it-and in a variety of chic designer colors and styles to boot.
   Most Shadowrun: Anarchy characters start each Mis- sion with a default set of weapons. These are listed on the character sheet along with the amount of damage they do when used successfully against a target, their range brackets, and any special effects or bonuses their use confers.
Here's what you need to know when using weapons:

Ranges: All weapons list three general range brackets:
• Close: Melee weapons, unarmed combat
• Near: Short-ranged weapons, such as pistols and shotguns
• Far: Long-ranged weapons, such as rifles and heavy weapons

   Each range bracket on a weapon listing can have three possible notations:
• OK: The weapon can be used at this range without penalty.
• -X: The weapon can be used at this range, but with a -X modifier.
• -: The weapon cannot be used at this range.

   For example, Sledge's Ares Predator V has the follow- ing range notation: Close OK, Near -2, Far -. This means it can fire at Close range targets without penalty, suffers a -2 modifier at Near range, and cannot affect targets at Far range. Which makes him sad, but he'll just have to get another gun if he wants to shoot far.
   There are no precise definitions for Close, Near, and Far ranges, mainly to prevent the game from be- ing bogged down in specific measurements. The basic definitions are that Close is within reach of a sword or similar melee weapon, either by swinging it where you are or taking a few quick steps toward a target. Near is farther than that, going far enough outward that you start reaching the limits of where pistols have a reason- able chance to hit. Being generous, that range is around 100 meters, without being precise. Far is any distance beyond that. Remember that it is rare for any weapon that's not artillery or something to fire more than half a kilometer, and going a full kilometer is rarer still. Just because a weapon is capable of firing to the Far range does not mean it can hit something on the other side of the sprawl. When in doubt, the gamemaster makes the call if someone can be hit by weapons fire.
   Unarmed Combat Damage: Your Strength deter- mines the damage you do when engaging in unarmed

combat. The damage you inflict is Stun damage equal to half Strength (rounded up), noted as (STR/2)S. Some Shadow Amps may increase this damage, or turn it into Physical damage.
   Close Combat Damage Bonus: Close Combat weap- ons start with the same (STR/2) basic damage and usual- ly add a bonus to that. Some of them, particularly blunt weapons, do Stun damage; others, like blades, do Phys- ical damage. The type of damage a weapon does is indi- cated by a P or S after the base damage.
   Carry Limits: Character sheets have six slots for weapons, so that's generally how many characters can have. If they want more, can figure out a way to list them, and have GM approval to have more, then go for it!
   If a character has a Skill that requires the use of their hands, then the character can't use that Skill if they are holding a weapon (or gear) in that hand. If there is the slightest doubt about how the character uses said Skill, before gameplay begins, the players and gamemaster will need to determine for their games whether a partic- ular Skill requires a free hand to use it.
   Ammo and Reloading: Shadowrun: Anarchy doesn't re- quire players to track things like ammunition, shots fired per turn, firing modes, reloading speeds, and so on. This is


RULES OF THE STREET	41



an action movie-all reloading is assumed to happen when the camera isn't pointed at you, if it happens at all.
   Secondary Effects: Generally speaking, Shadowrun: An- archy doesn't assume weapons have any other effects be- yond straight-up damage as noted on the various character sheets. Those weapons with additional effects are specifi- cally noted, of course. However, like the equipment also noted on the character sheets, players and gamemasters are free to come up with additional effects from a weapon, provided they can make a good Narration for it.
   For example, Sledge has an Ares Predator V on his character sheet (see p. 83). The player choosing Sledge could pitch to the group that this is a custom mod of that pistol. The modification would allow the weapon to fire riot rounds that always knock the target down after dealing its damage. The gamemaster feels that's too pow- erful for a gun that small and decides that the weapon can't be used at Close range, and further, if the weapon scores a hit, the target will make a Strength Test with a modifier determined by the gamemaster. If the target succeeds, he or she withstood the extra effects of getting hit with such a large riot round; if the target fails, he or she is immediately on their back until they can spend a Narration to stand back up.
   Meanwhile, in another situation, the gamemaster may decide Coydog's survival knife is actually an en- chanted weapon focus. When it hits, that weapon's mys- tical powers partially numb the target, so the target ap- plies a -1 modifier to any actions for the next two turns.
   And so on. As usual, unleash your imaginations at the table!
   Making the Game More or Less Lethal: The weapons on the character sheets are geared toward a good mix of play speed and fun combat action that'll span multiple turns of dice rolling to resolve a given situation. Howev- er, some groups may decide they want to switch things up to suit their style of play.
• Less Lethal: If a player group decides they want more dice rolling and heavier combat-oriented play, simply lower all Damage Values by 1, or even cut Damage Values in half. If weapons have a D6 for their Damage Value, change that to D6 - 1 damage.
• More Lethal: If another group wants quicker combat and more cinematic style where the good guys can take out the bad guys in a single swipe, reduce armor by half or more. The more armor goes away, the quicker people go down.

CHARACTER MOVEMENT 
In Shadowrun: Anarchy, there are no hard-and-fast rules for walking and running speeds, and weapon ranges are




abstracted. This places the focus on story and action. In many circumstances, the ranges are just approxima- tions, and the gamemaster can provide a ruling of the current range, and the players can move on. There are times, though, when more tactical movement may be needed, so here are some rules for closing or expanding ranges in such situations.
   Movement is based on the three different range brackets: Close, Near, and Far. See the Weapons section for more detail on how range brackets work.
   Movement from Close to Near, or Near to Close, re- quires a single movement when on foot. Moving on foot from Near to Far, or Far to Near, requires three move- ments. Note that these can be divided among multiple people involved in maneuvering around each other. For example, let's say a player and an NPC are at Far range, and both of them decide they want to be Near. The player uses their movement to get closer, and the NPC does the same. That's two movements (the gamemaster should track the progress of these movements), so if on the player's turn they decide to move closer again, they'll be in Near range. Just in time for the NPC to shoot. Oops.
   Note that characters can spend a Plot Point to take two movement actions to make this process go faster.
   There is one exception to this rule. If you moved from Far to Near or Near to Far, in the very next turn you can decide to move back to the range you left. If you don't make that move in the next turn, the opportunity is lost; it's assumed that others move or the universe realigns in some way that requires the three movements to get from Near to Far or vice versa.

DAMAGE, ARMOR,
AND THE CONDITION MONITOR 
Whenever a fight occurs or a dangerous situation is en- countered, there's a chance a character could take dam- age on the Condition Monitor.
   Damage: On every character sheet, there's a Weapons column that lists the weapons the character started the game with and its Damage Value. Whenever a character takes damage, the damage from the weapon is first ap- plied to the Armor column of the character sheet. Once all Armor circles are marked off, damage then begins to apply to the Condition Monitor. If that happens, it's time for some serious heroics before true disaster strikes.
   Physical Damage vs. Stun Damage: There are two types of damage on the Condition Monitor: Physical and Stun. Physical damage represents potentially lethal damage: gashes and gouges, burns and breaks, and so on. Stun represents nonlethal damage: bruises, fatigue, syn- aptic overload, certain spells, and so on. Weapons with a


42	RULES OF THE STREET




P notation in their Damage Value apply their damage to the Physical column on the Condition Monitor once ar- mor has been depleted, and weapons with an S notation damage the Stun column.
   Condition Monitor Flowchart: The Physical and Stun columns on the Condition Monitor of the character sheet take the form of flowcharts. Players start at the top, left- hand box of the damage column for the damage type and move to the right until the first row is marked off, then move to the left-hand box of the second row and move to the right until the second row is marked off, and so on.
• First Row: When the first row of boxes is filled, the character immediately applies a -1 modifier to all future die rolls.
• Second Row: When the second row of boxes is filled, a -2 modifier is applied to all die rolls. This replaces the -1 modifier from the first row instead of being cumulative.
• Third Row: When the third row of boxes is filled, a -3 modifier is applied to all die rolls. This replaces the -2 modifier from the second row instead of being cumulative.
• Fourth Row (if applicable): When the fourth row of boxes (if available) is filled, a -4 modifier
is applied to all die rolls. This replaces the -3 modifier from the third row instead of being cumulative.
• Staggered: When all of the boxes of either Condition Monitor are filled, the character simply cannot give anymore and may take no actions (he does not give any more Narrations until he's healed; he cannot spend any Plot Points either). However, there are instances in which a spell or Skill could still be in effect even if the character is Staggered; the final call on whether an action or Skill is still active while a character is Staggered is up to the GM.
• Knocked Out (Stun track only): If the character is damaged again with Stun damage after being Staggered on the Stun Condition Monitor, they are Knocked Out; they are out of commission until they receive healing.
• Killed in Action (Physical track only): If the character receives Physical damage again after being Staggered on the Physical Condition Monitor, they are at risk of being killed. They must make an Edge + Edge Test, starting at Very Easy difficulty and increasing in difficulty by one step each time more damage hits. If they fail this test, the character is dead; for more details, see Character Death, p. 44.
• Cumulative Wound Modifiers: If a character has a wound modifier on both the Physical damage

track and the Stun damage track, the highest modifiers on each track are added together for a single modifier. For example, if a character has suffered enough damage to have a -1 modifier on the Stun track and a -2 modifier on the Physical track, then the character incurs a total wound modifier of -3 for any die rolls until enough damage has been healed to reduce one or both of the modifiers.

   Regaining Armor/Condition Monitor Damage: For- tunately, there are many ways to repair Armor and heal Physical and Stun damage. A player could spend a Plot Point to regain a circle of Armor or Physical/Stun dam- age. Some characters carry first aid kits as equipment, which can restore Physical or Stun damage. Addition- ally, some characters are medics or magicians and can use an appropriate Skill to fix armor or heal a teammate, with each hit on the appropriate Skill Test healing a box of damage. Biotech can be used to heal damage to people, Electronics to repair damage to cyberdecks, and Engineering to repair damage to armor. Note that each person, device, vehicle, armor, or other piece of gear can only have one attempting healing or repair test per peri- od of combat; you can't just make test after test until all damage is healed or repaired.
   Some gear or spells may instantly repair damaged armor circles immediately after a combat; otherwise, armor, cyberdeck, and Condition Monitor damage are assumed to completely repair once the player has the equivalent of a night's worth of downtime. In this time, it is assumed that they put on a new piece of armor from storage or buy a replacement and are ready to roll.
   In some cases, though, players may need more rap- id or more thorough repair of their bodies, their gear, or their armor. In this case, characters will need to find someone who repairs armor and then offer them some form of payment. Since Anarchy does not have cash, a simple transfer of nuyen is not possible. Instead, armor repair must be paid for in one of the following ways:
• Pay 1 Karma for full armor repair. It's steep, yeah, but what good's Karma when you're dead? Sometimes you need to pony up to stay alive.
• Promise a favor. This means that the gamemaster gets to select the next Contract Brief, and
the player must accept that job without negotiating the compensation. This can be one of the pre-generated Contract Briefs, or any other one the gamemaster has. If a player has a pending favor, they cannot take on another one until they have at least started the Contract Brief that is part of the favor. It is possible that multiple members of the team


RULES OF THE STREET	43



may owe favors at the same time, leading to a string of favors they have to repay. In this case, the gamemaster determines which Contract Brief will fulfill the favor, but the team can decide between them which job they'll do first, second, and so on.

CHARACTER DEATH
As noted under Damage, Armor, and the Condition Monitor (see p. 42), the standard rules for the game al- low a character to die. Shadowrun: Anarchy is a roleplay- ing game about the mean and gritty shadows of the Sixth World, and here, when a character dies, they stay dead.
   That being said, some players may agree that a Killed In Action character isn't truly dead, but there should still be some consequences for a character running rough- shod over his or her whole Condition Monitor. Or maybe the player was Killed In Action far too early in an eve- ning's gaming session due to bad luck, and they don't want to sit out for the rest of the session. For these situ- ations, here are a few options players can use to provide more depth of play:
   The players should decide as a group which of these options are allowed and which option a player will use if a character is Killed In Action during a game. For each of these options, the character heals one box on their Phys- ical Condition Monitor and is ready to move-hopefully out of harm's way.
• Don't count me out just yet: The character spends all but 1 of their available Plot Points to avoid being Killed In Action and suffer
no further effects. If the character has only 1 available Plot Point to spend, this option
cannot be chosen and another option must be chosen instead.
• Just give me a minute: In addition to the standard wound modifiers for damage on the Condition Monitor, the character will suffer an additional -1 modifier on all Tests and Combat rolls for his next 2 Narrations.
• I'll never be the same: Permanently reduce the character's total Physical and Stun Condition Monitor boxes by 1. Strength and Willpower remain unaffected.
• I've had better days: Permanently lower one random Attribute by 1. If Strength or Willpower is the affected Attribute, use the new value to reduce the character's total Physical or Stun Condition Monitors as per standard character creation rules (see p. 61). The Attribute can subsequently be improved as normal through Character Advancement rules (p. 70).



SEIZING THE INITIATIVE 
When you're wired to the gills or amped up on reflex-en- hancement magic, the world seems to slow down around you. You gain a fly-like perception, which often allows you to spot the perfect place to jump into the action to take the right shot or save someone's life.
   To accomplish these kinds of feats, many characters who have Shadow Amps that improve their reaction are given a number of Plot Points at the beginning of each Scene. This can help them in combat, and may make these speedy characters more likely to perform actions such as Take the hit or A dish best served cold (see p. 52)

USING GEAR 
Some characters carry a variety of gear that might be helpful during or after a fight. The uses of many of the different items may be obvious: a medkit would help treat a character who's been injured, or a tool kit could be used to repair armor or other devices. The intended application of other gear may be obscure or even totally unknown. In many cases, this is intentional and gives the players a chance to decide exactly what that gear does, based on the name. Gear is there to fuel Narrations and open up possibilities for storytelling, rather than carry specific mechanics.

HACKING AND CYBERCOMBAT 
Since its introduction, the virtual data network of the Ma- trix has become a ubiquitous aspect of life for metahumans around the world, and deckers the world over ride the elec- trons to keep information free. The following rules provide guidelines on how to hack into systems and engage in cy- bercombat within the virtual world of the Matrix.
   AR vs. VR: Deckers can access the Matrix in two ways: via AR (augmented reality) or VR (virtual reality). When using AR, you interact with the Matrix via a software win- dow, viewing your persona, files, and other Matrix objects as icons in the window. However, when you're using VR, you dive into the virtual world, putting your whole aware- ness into the Matrix: you become your persona.
   Accessing the Matrix via AR does not confer any bo- nuses, but going full VR confers a +1 bonus to any Hack- ing Tests. This bonus is noted on Shadow Amps that allow VR connection, such as datajacks and trodes, and it always applies in VR, even if another Amp is used to affect a Test while in VR.
   However, when in VR, you cannot take any actions or use any Skills that would require the use of your physical body (gamemaster's discretion), and cybercombat (see below) can be more lethal.


44	RULES OF THE STREET




   Hacking: Now that you've gotten access to the Ma- trix, you probably want to start doing something that the ever-vigilant Grid Overwatch Division deems ille- gal. To defy GOD, you'll need your trusty Hacking Skill. Anything you want to access or control-be it a security camera, an electronic keypad, a secure system, a cer- tain file, any Matrix-connected device, and so on-will require you to hack into the virtual Matrix object that represents it.
   To make a hacking attempt, roll a standard Hacking Test and apply an applicable Shadow Amp effect or a bonus conferred by a cyberdeck. Failure might not nec- essarily trigger an alarm, but you are certainly free to narrate one if you think it will benefit the storytelling. If the Test is successful, you have succeeded in putting a mark-your persona's digital signature-on the Ma- trix object and can now access it. Certain objects, such as hostile Matrix objects like IC, sprites, and other per- sonas cannot be marked and instead must be defeated in cybercombat.
   Cybercombat: When a decker accesses the Matrix ei- ther via AR or full VR, all combat that takes place there will be cybercombat between their virtual persona and various Matrix threats, such as hostile personas and sprites, intrusion countermeasures (IC), and so on. Cy- bercombat represents using brute force in the Matrix, by sending data spikes and malicious code intended to crash the targeted threat.
   To engage in cybercombat, the attacker must spend an attack action (see Attack Limits, p. 40). Use the Hacking Skill and an applicable Shadow Amp, such as a program, to aid the attack. Sprites and other Matrix constructs will use an appropriate Skill. Defense dice roll Logic + Firewall. Thus the dice-rolling mechanic for cy- bercombat is:

    Hacking Dice + Logic Dice + Modifiers (if any) + Shadow Amp Effect (if any) vs. Logic Dice + Firewall Dice + Modifiers (if any) + Shadow Amp Effect (if any)

   Stun damage to a decker using a cyberdeck is ap- plied to the Condition Monitor of the cyberdeck itself, regardless of whether the target is using AR or VR (a cyberdeck's Condition Monitor is [(Device Rating / 2) + 8]. Physical damage, when using VR, is applied direct- ly to the character's Condition Monitor, bypassing any armor worn; if using AR, apply Physical damage to the cyberdeck's Condition Monitor instead. When a cyber- deck's Condition Monitor is completely filled, the user is kicked out of the Matrix, and the cyberdeck is severely damaged, requiring the expenditure of 1 Karma to get working again, which not only makes it functional but fully repairs the Condition Monitor.
  
The Electronics Skill can be used to repair cyberdeck damage. See Damage, Armor, and the Condition Moni- tor, p. 42.

DIVING DEEP INTO THE MATRIX: OPTIONAL MATRIX RULES 
For the ease of Shadowrun: Anarchy play, the mechanics for hacking the Matrix are intended to be simple and straightforward to keep action high; however, many players may wish to add an additional level of depth and intrigue to their Matrix experience. Here are a couple of optional guidelines that deck cowboys and virtuakinet- ics can include in their games if they wish.
   Marks: In standard rules, only a single mark is needed to gain access to a Matrix object. When using advanced rules, the number of marks needed is deter- mined by the GM. This number can vary depending on the security level and the difficulty of the Hacking Test. For example, hacking into a coffin motel's vending ma- chine would be Very Easy (4 opposing dice) and only re- quire a single mark. Spoofing a security camera at your local McHugh's might have a difficulty of Easy (6 oppos- ing dice) and need two marks to gain access to it. But if you're trying to sleaze into a file vault at a high-securi- ty Renraku data farm, then the difficulty might ratchet up to Hard (10 opposing dice) and require three or four marks to gain access.
   Noise: Standard rules assume that you will have a perfect connection between your cyberdeck and the sys- tem or device you are attempting to sleaze or brute-force your way into. However, in reality, this is rarely the case. A veritable soup of ARO spam (AR objects), electronic countermeasures, and so forth create an ever-worsen- ing signal-to-noise ratio that only degrades further the greater the distance away from your target you are.
   To determine noise, treat all Hacking actions as though you are using a weapon with the following range brackets: Close OK, Near -2, Far -4. (See Weapons, p. 40, for more about ranges). For example, if the system or device you are attempting to access is in Near range, you would apply a -2 modifier for any Hacking Tests made for or in that system.
   Technomancers: Technomancers, a.k.a. virtuaki- netics, are those rare few who can use a poorly under- stood ability to wirelessly access the Matrix directly with their own brains, without the need for a cyberdeck, a commlink, or any form of hardware or software. By us- ing their own brains like computer software, a techno- mancer can experience the Matrix in AR or full VR.
   The following rules govern the use of technomancers in Shadowrun: Anarchy.


RULES OF THE STREET	45



• Complex Forms: Technomancers have no cyberdeck to hold programs. Instead they possess complex forms, Shadow Amps that replicate the effects of certain cyberdeck programs. These are applied in Matrix-related Tests and cybercombat just like standard Shadow Amps.
• Cybercombat Defense: Technomancers have no hardware to rely on in cyber combat, so they roll Logic x 2 against the attacker's dice when defending in cybercombat.
• Matrix Damage: Technomancers use their bare brains with no buffer against malignant computer code. Damage a technomancer suffers in cybercombat is applied directly
to the appropriate track on the character's Condition Monitor, regardless of AR or VR. Any Shadow Amps that reduce cybercombat damage can be used to lower the damage received. When a technomancer's Condition Monitor reaches Staggered, Knocked Out, or Killed In Action, their persona is kicked out of the Matrix.
• Sprites: The constantly flowing data streams have also given rise to strange virtual entities known as sprites. Only technomancers can use the Tasking Skill to compile sprites from the Resonance, the energy streaming throughout the Matrix; deckers cannot compile sprites.

   Compiling a sprite costs a full attack action. Success on a Tasking Test summons one sprite of the chosen type. A successfully conjured sprite acts like an NPC and has its own NPC sheet, but unless the gamemaster says otherwise, the player who compiled a sprite narrates the sprite's actions and rolls the sprite's dice during their own Narration.
   A player may only have one compiled sprite at a time. To compile another, the player must first either decom- pile it with a successful Tasking Test (upon which it will return to the Resonance) or let its last Condition Moni- tor box get damaged.
   Sprites are Matrix entities and thus can only be dam- aged in cybercombat or by another technomancer using the Tasking Skill to decompile the sprite.
   Decompiling a sprite into harmless, random lines of code costs a full attack action. Use the Tasking Skill in a cybercombat roll against the sprite's defense dice. If the roll succeeds, deal the sprite a number of damage equal to the technomancer's Logic.



SPELLS, SPIRITS, AND ASTRAL COMBAT 
Mana is a constant, everyday reality in the Sixth World, and knowing its ins and outs is a good way to stay alive. The following rules provide guidelines on how to cast spells, conjure and command spirits, and engage in as- tral combat on the astral plane.
   Spells: Spells in Shadowrun: Anarchy fall into two cat- egories: combat spells and effect spells. Combat spells inflict damage, either Physical or Stun; effect spells ac- complish some form of non-damaging effect.
   Casting a spell counts as an attack action for your Nar- ration (see Attack Limits, p. 40). To cast a spell, make a Sorcery Test (opposed by the target, as listed with the spell, and use the Shadow Amp effect for the chosen spell. Suc- cess means the spell was cast successfully: a noncombat spell's effect occurs, or a combat spell applies its damage.
   The damage and defense dice for a combat spell is listed in its description. Net hits by the attacker are ei- ther added as damage or have some other effect, based on the spell.
   For example, let's take a look at Coydog's Lightning Bolt spell:

Lightning Bolt (Spell): 6P/AA Reroll one failed die
Defense: S + W

   The Shadow Amp effect lets Coydog reroll one die, and the defender will roll Strength and Willpower (S + W) against Coydog's hits. If Coydog wins the roll, then the defender will take 6P damage; the AA stands for Ar- mor Avoidance, which means that any net hits on the spellcasting test do not add to the damage as normal, but rather indicate damage that bypassed the target's armor. So if Coydog rolled 4 hits and the target rolled 2, she has 2 net hits, meaning she did 6P damage total, and 2P of that bypasses the target's armor and goes right to the Condition Monitor. If a spell with Armor Avoidance has more net hits than the total amount of damage inflicted by the spell, all damage avoids armor, and the extra net hits have no further effect.
   Combat spells are instantaneous; the spell immedi- ately ends once its damage has been applied.
   Effect spells last for as long as the spellcaster and story requires the spell to last. When the caster's next Narration arrives, the player can simply declare they are sustaining the spell they cast last turn; no Sorcery Test is needed. A character may only sustain one spell at a time. Depending on the complexity of the spell and/or how many turns the player has sustained the spell, the game- master may impose a negative modifier for any rolls the player makes while sustaining a spell.


46	RULES OF THE STREET




   Spirits: Players and NPCs can use the Conjuring Skill to summon spirits. Success on a Conjuring Test summons one spirit of the chosen type. Spirits are listed as NPCs on p. 138 to make things easy for both players and game- masters. If a player wants to summon a particularly pow- erful spirit, the GM should increase the difficulty of the opposed roll and then give more powerful spells or effects to the spirit should the Conjuring Test succeed. A suc- cessfully conjured spirit acts like an NPC and has its own NPC sheet, but unless the gamemaster says otherwise, the player who conjured a spirit narrates the spirit's actions and rolls the spirit's dice during their own Narration.
   Conjuring a spirit costs an attack action. Under nor- mal circumstances, a player may only have one conjured spirit at a time. To conjure another, the player must first either dismiss the existing spirit with a successful Conjuring Test (upon which it will vanish), let it reach Knocked Out or Killed In Action, or wait until the spirit vanishes at dawn or at dusk.
   Spirits are resilient and can only be easily damaged by spells, weapon foci, the Conjuring Skill, and the Astral Combat Skill (only in astral space:
see Astral Combat below). Howev- er, it is possible to hurt a spir-
it by putting the force of one's will into a physical strike. To attack a spir-
it in this way, use Close Combat + Willpower (in- stead of Agility) with a -2 modifier. If success- ful, apply the attack- er's Unarmed weapon damage to the spirit.
   Banishing a spirit severs the mystical con- nection between the spirit and its summoner. Use the Conjuring Skill in a combat
roll against the spirit's defense dice. If the roll succeeds, deal the
spirit a number of Stun damage equal to the magician's Willpower.
   Astral Projection: A magician can visit the astral plane by undergoing astral projection. This is accom- plished by voluntarily detaching your essence and leav- ing your corporeal body behind in meat space. No test is needed for leaving your body or for returning to it later. However, if you return to find out your body has been moved in the interim, you have a different set of chal- lenges to face.
   Astral Combat: All combat that takes place on the astral plane is astral combat. On the astral plane, char-

acters can battle against spirits, dual-natured critters (which inhabit both the physical and astral planes si- multaneously), wards and other astral phenomena, oth- er astrally projecting magicians, and so forth.
   To engage in astral combat, the attacker must spend an attack action (see Attack Limits, p. 40). Use the As- tral Combat Skill (or just Willpower, if untrained), and you may apply an applicable Shadow Amp, such as a damaging spell or a weapon focus, to aid their attack. Spirits and other astral denizens will use an appropriate Skill to engage in astral combat.
   Any damage characters and NPCs take in astral com- bat is applied to the Stun track of the Condition Monitor.

 VEHICLE AND DRONE COMBAT 
Between the constant threat of go-gangs, police chas- es, military campaigns, and other vehicular shenani- gans, there's bound to be some pedal-to-the-metal ac- tion in Shadowrun: Anarchy. Vehicle and drone combat is handled in the same way as standard Tests
and combat rolls. Here are a few spe- cific clarifications to help you burn
rubber.
AR vs. VR: Vehicles and drones equipped with a Rigger Interface can be piloted either via AR (augmented reality) or VR (virtual reality). When
 using AR, you either con- trol the vehicle manually or with a remote-control rig via an AR window. When you're using VR, you put your
   whole awareness into a vehi- cle or drone: you are the vehi- cle. Piloting a vehicle via AR does
       not confer any bonuses, but jump- ing into the vehicle and piloting via VR confers a +1 bonus to any Piloting or Vehicle
   Weapons Tests. This bonus is noted on the Control Rig Shadow Amp, and it always applies in VR, even if another Shadow Amp is used to affect a Test while in VR. When in VR, you cannot take any actions or use any Skills that would require the use of your physical body (GM's discretion).
   Vehicle Movement: A character piloting a vehicle can move that vehicle from Far to Close with regards to a person on foot in a single action. They can also slow it down and move it from Far to Near in a single action (the reverse of these two actions also apply). This only


RULES OF THE STREET	47



applies in relation to a character on foot; if a character is in a vehicle, the normal movement rules apply.
   Maneuvering and Stunts: Normal driving or piloting tasks like changing speeds and ranges don't require dice rolls, just a good Narration. However, if you want to at- tempt something risky-a hairpin turn, weaving through traffic, sliding your bike under a semi truck, driving a car on two wheels through a narrow alley, ramming another car, avoiding knocked-down debris, or some other dan- gerous moving violation-make a standard Test using the appropriate Piloting Skill (or just Agility, if untrained) and any modifiers the gamemaster deems applicable. If you are successful, the maneuver executes as planned; if you fail, you'd better hope you're wearing a helmet and/or have an up-to-date DocWagon contract: see Crashes below.
   Attacking from a Vehicle or Drone: A character at- tempting an attack while inside or top of a vehicle or while piloting a drone makes a combat roll as normal, using an appropriate Skill. Due to the nature of fighting from on or inside a vehicle, appropriate modifiers apply to the attack. Most modifiers are up to the gamemaster, but here are some examples:
• Passenger firing a personal weapon from a moving vehicle: -1 or -2, depending on speed
• Firing at a stationary vehicle: +3
• Firing at a vehicle moving at top speed: -3.

   Note that these modifiers do not apply to riggers us- ing Shadow Amp drones or vehicles; they are assumed to have the skill to adapt to the movement of their equip- ment, and they simply receive the bonus as noted by the Amp. A character who attacks with any vehicle- or drone-mounted weaponry cannot use their own indi- vidual weapons during that same Narration.
   Attacking a Vehicle or Drone: Combat actions against a piloted vehicle or drone are resolved like normal com- bat rolls, but the defender rolls the Agility + Logic of the pilot or driver controlling the targeted vehicle.
   Damage to Vehicles and Drones: Vehicles and drones both have a number of Armor circle representing how much damage they can take. Successful attacks against a vehicle damage the vehicle's Armor pips and not the pas- sengers. Once a vehicle's armor is depleted, the vehicle is out of commission and probably totaled, depending on the situation. Vehicle armor can be repaired in the same manner as character armor. When Shadow Amp drone lose all of their armor, they are not lost, but the Amp can- not be used until at least one Armor circle is repaired.
   Crashes: If a vehicle crashes due to a failed Piloting Test or vehicle damage, the vehicle, pilot, and passen- gers will take damage equal to Damage Value of the ve- hicle's Ramming weapon. If the vehicle does not have Ramming, apply Physical damage equal to the vehicle's Durability divided by 2.




   Storytelling: How damage to a vehicle affects its movement, weapons fire, and so on is absolutely up to the plot and how the storyline is developing: just remember that any vehicle is as strong-or not-as the plot needs it to be (though some Mission Briefs will provide specifics to help things alone). Instead of tracking the nitty-grit- ty details of damage effects to a vehicle, the gamemaster should weave that type of information into the narrative: engine sputtering and billowing smoke; tires shredding; explosive decompressions (if in space), or flooding with water (if underwater); ammo exploding (if in a military vehicle); abrupt one-thousand-meter drops in altitude (if flying); power system fluctuations and failures. The sky is the limit for the fun and challenging scenarios you can throw at players to overcome during such a conflict.

 ADDITIONAL RULES 
The Cue System is not rules heavy. Instead, it's about creating a framework off of which players simply spin up their imaginations through improv play to work through whatever characters, environments, and terrain they may come across. However, the very nature of magic and machine-not to mention exotic places like ghoul realms, magical disaster areas, the toxic northern beach- es of the Allied German States, or any other unusual lo- cale populating the Sixth World-means players might stumble a bit here and there.
   For those that would like a few more guidelines when dealing with extreme situations, use the following rules. Of course, these can be used to craft further rules that will cover a variety of other circumstances and locales a player group may encounter.

BREATHING 
Various situation and environments, such as toxic areas, being underwater, or running out of oxygen in a space en- vironment, may threaten a character's ability to breathe. A character can hold their breath for a number of Narrations equal to their Strength divided by three, rounded up. Once this period expires, the character will suffer 1 point of Stun Damage (ignoring Armor ) until they can safely take another breath. Once a character has been reduced to Knocked Out status, he will take 2 boxes of Physical damage until breathing can resume or
all Condition Monitor boxes are crossed off.

instances, as usual, final adjudication for what does or doesn't work under these circumstances falls under the GM's purview.
• Darkness: A dim room or fighting at night inflicts a -1 modifier to all die rolls; complete darkness conveys a -3 modifier. Numerous characters
or NPCs might ignore this due to various gear (night vision goggles), an appropriate Kiken Aug (cybereyes), or natural abilities (a dwarf or troll with thermographic vision).
• Acid and toxic waste: Coming in contact with acid, toxic waste, or other corrosive
substances will cause a lasting damage effect. Any such substance initially inflicts 2 points of damage to armor, or 1 point of Physical damage if armor is depleted. Unless the substance can be immediately washed off or treated with a repair kit (for armor damage) or some form of healing (for Physical damage), the substance will inflict the same amount of damage for another two Narrations (or turns for NPCs without Narrations) before rendering itself inert.
• Liquid Metals/Rocks: There are numerous situations where characters might encounter magma or molten metals, such as a foundry in a Saeder-Krupp factory or active volcanoes in the Kingdom of Hawai'i. Coming in contact
with such a substance causes 3 points of armor damage and 1 point of Physical damage as the character starts to cook. Incidental splashes of such substances only cause 1 armor damage.
• Hot/noxious gas: Hot/noxious gas affects visibility by imposing a -2 modifier when a character or NPC is trying to attack into or through a cloud of gas. Moving through a jet of gas causes 2 points of Physical damage, regardless of how many armor circles the character has remaining (i.e., no armor circles are reduced).
• Underwater: Due to the difficulty with moving while submerged in water, ranged weapons suffer a -1 modifier, and melee weapons incur a -3 modifier.
• Airless vacuum: Treat any airless situation as forcing characters to hold their breath (see Breathing, p. 48).



MIND CONTROL 
Various enemies and characters may have the ability to take over a character and control her actions, via a Mind Control spell, chemical coercion, brainwashing, spiritual possession, or other nefarious means. When this occurs, the following rules are in effect.
   When a character or NPC is under the effects of mind control, the controlling player dictates that person's ac- tions during the character or NPCs appropriate Narra- tions rather than the controlling player. Successful mind control will remain in effect until the affected character resists the control or the controlling enemy is Staggered or Knocked Out.
   A successful mind control attempt will last a mini- mum of one of the affected character's Narrations. Every subsequent Narration, the affected character must take a Willpower + Logic Test; succeeding in the Test ends the mind control.
   An NPC controlling a character may not make the character perform any actions that would result in her own death or the death of her companions; she will dis- believe those actions so strongly that the enemy can- not force her to take them. In other words, a mind-con- trolled character cannot shoot herself in the temple, shove a character out a window, and so on. However, groups who prefer a more realistic and gritty campaign may agree to allow such potentially lethal actions.

 PLAYING ANARCHY 
Shadowrunners know that it's one thing to know what you're supposed to do on a run, but it's another to know how to pull it off with style. You've seen the basic rules for playing Shadowrun: Anarchy; here now are some tips for playing it well, making the game go smoothly, and pulling off runs you'll be talking about long after the game is played.

WHEN IT'S YOUR NARRATION 
It's great when you can do something extraordinary, unusual, or hilarious on every Narration, but remem- ber-one of the reasons a Plot Point is awarded for a par- ticularly good Narration is that such Narrations do not happen every turn.
What this means is that while players should al-
ways be looking for opportunities to do the extraordi- nary, they should not feel too much pressure to come up with something amazing every turn. Your first job is to let everyone know what your character is up to and provide details about what is happening around them; accomplish that much, and the story will keep moving. Anything you add to that is gravy.
   Here are some things to consider when building your Narration that can help add unusual twists or other ele- ments that will keep the game interesting.

HOW CAN YOUR CHARACTER
KEEP THE OPPOSITION ON THEIR TOES?
There are always obstacles in the Sixth World-peo- ple and things trying to keep you from earning your


much-needed Karma. Good shadowrunners know how to stay a step or two ahead of them. When your Narra- tion comes up, other people, both PCs and NPCs, will be doing things, and so much of what you will be do- ing is responding to them (on the simplest level, if they shoot, you shoot back). If you can do more than just re- act, though, and can make a move that will stymie the opposition, or anticipate their next move, or just plain confuse them, you'll not only put yourself in good posi- tion for whatever happens next, but you'll take the story in interesting directions.
   Some examples: If you see you're being followed, the simplest thing is to try to shake the tail. But more ad- vanced techniques include changing your destination and leading the tail to somewhere you did not intend to travel, or creating an illusory car to make an extra chal- lenge for the pursuers. Another example is having a se- curity guard ask to see your clearance. You may attempt to pass with genuine or fake credentials, but if you want to throw security a curveball, confess your complete lack of credentials, then work to weave a narrative that will make security want to let you in anyway ("There's a team of shadowrunners in your facility right now, and your best chance of stopping them and maybe saving your fraggin' job is to let me back there!").

HOW CAN YOU SHOW THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE YOUR CHARACTER DISTINCT?
Each character in the Street People chapter has some trait or characteristic that make them unusual and dif- ferent from the rest of the pack. These are embodied in the Dispositions, Cues, and Backgrounds, and they can


BUILDING STREET CRED	51




provide guides for characters to respond to challenges in ways that are in character and unique. Use them to take actions that will bend the story in compelling directions. For example, let's say a corp exec is the target of an unwilling extraction, and in her effort to hold off the shadowrunners, she has taken a hostage. Different shad- owrunners have potential responses that could take the story in interesting directions. Shades' background (p. 120) in a corporate environment might make her want to opt for reason, helping the exec understand her posi- tion and why it might be good to go along-and let the poor hostage go. Knox (p. 104), on the other hand, has a chip on her shoulder and a willingness to use force to mix things up, so she might decide that the hostage situation is best resolved with some fast punches to the head. Let
the characters' natures add twists to the stories.

WHAT'S COOL IN THE SIXTH WORLD?
This is a loaded question, because the answer is: a lot. Be- tween magical alchera-vaguely material bridges to oth- er dimensions-ferocious critters, savage toxic shamans, crazed gillettes and razorgirls, drakes working in the ser- vice of their draconic masters, enigmatic free spirits, and much more, there are a ton of elements out there that can be thrown in to a story. If the game you're in needs some- thing to juice it up, reach into the Shadowrun bag of tricks and pick out an element that you really like, especially if it's something that hasn't been in your game for a while. Nothing like a roaming free spirit to shake the game up!

WHAT WILL MAKE THE
GAME BETTER FOR OTHER PLAYERS?
This is always a good guideline, but some specific ap- plications of it can help the game move well. Is there a player who has not had a chance to use their best skills recently? Steer the story in a way that will give them something to do. Did a player introduce a new element? Build on it to make sure it becomes part of the story. Look for opportunities to make sure everyone is includ- ed and interesting things keep happening, and the game will go better for all.
   This guideline can also help you know how long to make your narration, paying attention to how others are reacting, how involved they are, and how anxious they are for their turn to begin. Paying attention to such ele- ments will make you a better player.

WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR NARRATION 
Just because it's not your turn doesn't mean you have nothing to do at the table. Planning for your Narra-

tion, including how your character will react to un- folding developments, is part of what you can do, but far from the only things. Interactions between players is one of the best parts of role-playing, and Anarchy works best when that continues. The play- er conducting the Narration will be moving the sto- ry forward, but other players are free to contribute thoughts, advice, quick character responses, and of course the occasional smart remark. The guideline is the same as the last question asked above: What will make the game better? Keeping the Narration from moving forward, interrupting too much, or criticizing the choices of the player will likely not help make the game work well. Adding ideas and humor will. Sup- port the Narration in the way you want your Narra- tion supported!

 DIFFERENT WAYS TO RUN 
One of the advantages of the Anarchy game model is that it's flexible. The default Turns and Narration structure allows for turn order and the use of Plot Points to be its initiative structure; the storytelling and initiative are in- tertwined in order to make for a more narrative-focused experience. Some groups may prefer different playing styles, though, so tweaking a few elements can adapt it to suit their playing styles. This section offers a few tweaks that some groups might want to use: a way to concentrate most gamemaster powers in a single person at the table, and two alternate initiative systems-one that is more mechanically based, rather than the default narrative-based initiative system, and another that is more free-flowing and cinematic.

A MORE FOCUSED GAMEMASTER 
Rotating the shared elements of the gamemaster back into a single GM is primarily about limiting how Plot Points may be spent so that they fit more traditional player roles. This means that player uses of Plot Points would include the following:
• Double time it: Take two movement actions to close on-or get away from-an opponent
• First aid: Heal a point of Physical or Stun damage.
• Take the hit: If a weaker or injured character is successfully hit by a combat action-i.e., the target rolled fewer hits than the attacker-then a player can spend a Plot Point to take the hit instead. The original target's defense roll is ignored, and the interrupting player rolls their own defense dice against the attacker's hits.


52	BUILDING STREET CRED



• A dish best served cold: Immediately take one free attack action against the NPC who just attacked you. This attack does not count as a Narration.
• Glitch Die: The Glitch Die can be used, but it is no longer applied to other players (though the GM can of course still apply it as they feel appropriate). Instead, players can pay
a Plot Point to include a Glitch Die on one of their own rolls in the hopes of getting an
Exploit (p. 39). If they roll a Glitch (p. 39) the player can either accept it as is, or spend two Plot Points to avoid the Glitch. Remember the Narrative nature of Shadowrun: Anarchy,
however, and if the player manages to create a memorable Narration to explain how the glitch was avoided, the gamemaster should award the player a Plot Point back (meaning that in effect, it only cost 1 Plot Point to avoid the problem).

   Each player group that selects this rule will ultimate- ly need to come to a consensus on what a player can and can't spend Plot Points on and how much that can affect GM-like events.
   Gamemaster: When using this rule, the following ad- ditional rules apply to how the gamemaster may spend Plot Points:
• A GM can spend a number of Plot Points per turn equal to the number of players. However,
only two Plot Points may be spent on the same player a turn.
• A GM earns two Plot Points for every Plot Point spent by a Player.

   One other change that needs to be made to play with a more traditional gamemaster is to make Perception Tests (p. 38) more traditional-that is, instead of having the player describe what they see if they win the test, the GM gives them the information, with more information coming based on how many net hits the player rolled.

ROLLING INITIATIVE 
Shadowrun: Anarchy's initiative system is based on two primary things-the position of people at the table and the use of Plot Points. It is built to be non-intrusive and fast-moving. Some groups, though, might want a more mechanically oriented system-so we have one!
   In this system, players roll for initiative to determine who goes first. Generally speaking, initiative should be rolled at the beginning of each Scene, and then would stay consistent for the whole Scene. Depending on the

BUILDING STREET CRED	53



group's tolerance for rolling dice, initiative could be rolled before each combat starts, or even at the begin- ning of each round of combat.
To use this system, follow these steps:
• Each player should start building their Initiative Dice Pool using the following number of dice based upon their Game Level (see p. 62): Gang = 4 dice; Street Runner = 6 dice; Prime Runner = 8 dice.
• For each element of a character sheet that provides additional Plot Points (such as Shadow Amps or Qualities), that player adds a D6 for each bonus Plot Point they would receive. For example, Improved Reflexes 2, among other things, provides a +1 Plot Point per Scene, which means that player would add 1D6 to their Initiative Dice Pool. (In that instance, the Shadow Amps still provides the Plot Point generation during game play.)
• Finally, each player may spend any amount of Plot Points they have at the start of a Scene to add dice to their Initiative Dice Pool; one Plot Point equals 1D6.
• All players roll their Initiative Dice Pool; characters with the highest number of successes go first in the round, moving down to those with the least. Ties are broken by looking to see which of the tied players have the highest Edge. If Edge ratings are the same, break the tie with Agility. If ties remain, simply us the order tied players are seated, starting from the GM's left and ending with the GM. The GM should track initiative order and tell players when it is their turn to act. Players with extra Combat Actions from Shadow Amps may still use them.
• At the start of the next Scene (or combat or round), repeat.



CINEMATIC INITIATIVE 
For groups that want a more cinematic or freestyle method of handling Initiative and Narrations, use the following:
   The first Narration when combat starts is handled in an intuitive, narrative fashion based on an agreement of the players (who sprang the ambush, who escalated the stare- down by going for a gun, who has the highest appropriate Attribute, or a Shadow Amp related to speed or percep- tion, and so on). When that player is finished, they choose who goes next based on what makes sense for the story or, when in doubt, where a hypothetical camera would be watching the fight if it were an action movie (meaning the first player to act might be a teammate attempting to co- ordinate with their fast friend, or it might go to the enemy that was just attacked, so that the action stays focused on the characters locked in close combat, for instance).
   Narrations proceed, with the group choosing who goes next after each Narration, until every character has gone once. NPCs may be grouped together to speed this process up (so that a small group of low-level guards could act all at once, while their more dangerous secu- rity officer might have her own spot in this rotation). Plot Points may still be used to jump forward in line if a player so chooses, though naturally this will happen less due to the way initiative is established. Still, as events unfold in combat, some unexpected things may happen, leading to a player wanting to move their turn forward.
   The character that acts last in a round then gets to choose who goes first in the next round. If it's what makes sense, it can even be them! Narrations contin- ue in that vein until everyone has acted for the second time, then you repeat the process as long as the action keeps up, round after round.

CONTROLLING ANARCHY


Whether you're a veteran of the Shadowrun universe or just starting out on your adventures with the Cue Sys- tem, gamemasters can benefit from some advice on how to help their Shadowrun: Anarchy games run smoothly and keep the enjoyment factor high. The following sec- tions cover a number of topics and situations that gam- emasters might encounter in their games.


PASSING THE MICROPHONE: TRADITIONAL ROLEPLAYING GAMES VS. THE CUE SYSTEM
One thing that makes Anarchy different from many other RPGs is that players do not describe only their actions, with the gamemaster describing the rest of the world around them and making the plot move forward. In An- archy, players have more free rein to introduce NPCs, de- scribe their actions, add in other elements, and describe the setting. While this may take some adjusting for GMs accustomed to traditional RPGs, this style can be seen as a great opportunity for GMs that puts less of a burden on them. They do not have to plan the whole story or have a roster of NPCs that they intend to introduce to the ad- venture. Their role is less about creating a master design at the outset of an adventure or campaign, and more about responding to the elements the players introduce while throwing interesting ideas of their own, helping the story move along while making sure all the players have a chance to shine. This role can involve some quick thinking and adaptability, but tapping into the creativity of the group can spread that work around, meaning the

gamemaster will primarily be looking at keeping the sto- ry moving and making sure players and their characters feel like they have something useful to do.
   In Anarchy, players are still going to primarily see the game from the perspective of their characters, so signif- icant parts of their Narrations will focus on what their characters do and how they respond to events around them. They also might decide to describe the actions of some NPCs, or add twists to the environment around them (such as introducing a sudden burst of acid rain, or a wild critter wandering close to the characters). This means that during another player's Narration, the GM no longer has total control over the story or the game. During another player's Narration, the GM's main re- sponsibilities are as follows:
• Deciding whether an action requires the player roll a Test
• Declaring what modifiers (if any) apply to a Test
• Determining what Attribute(s) applies to an Attribute-only Test
• Roleplaying NPCs
• Making defense rolls for NPCs
• Knowing the information in the Contract Brief
• Arbitrating rules discussions
• Declaring that a player's Narration is finished (such as if a Narration has lasted for too long)

   Many other elements that might be considered tradi- tional RPG gamemaster duties-describing the scene, de- tailing what NPCs are doing, having enemies appear, and so forth-fall to the player who is currently giving a Nar- ration. The GM's main role in relation to these elements is to listen carefully and to see how to use the events and plot twists the characters are using in the ongoing story.


CONTROLLING ANARCHY	55



   When you're the GM and another player is giving a Narration, you might be tempted to jump in and correct them or do something out of turn. However, think of a Narration as a microphone: only the person holding the mic can describe what is going on in the game itself. You, the GM, start the turn with the mic. Once you set the scene for the turn, you pass the mic to the next play- er, and then it's their time to speak. When other players have the mic, just kick back and let them have their mo- ment, keeping in mind the "Yes, and ..." improv spirit of the Cue System. The only time you need to interject is for one of the conditions in the list above.
   For those who are more familiar with traditional-style RPGs, it may help to think of Narrations in this way: When a player is giving their Narration, they act like a "micro-gamemaster" for the game, but only during their Narration. When the next player gives a Narration, they act like a micro-gamemaster for that Narration, and so on. Because each player helps craft the story on their turn, the goal of Anarchy games is collaborative storytell- ing; in the end, the players and GM should be working
together to create something memorable and fun.


 KEEPING IT CIVIL:	 PREVENTING ABUSE
One of the GM's duties is to make sure the game runs smoothly and that everyone has fun. Here are a few sug- gestions to prevent players from abusing the game or keeping other players from having fun.

REFEREEING 
One of the double-edged swords of the Cue System is control. The players enjoy a lot more control over the game during their Narration, but they can seize too much control if the GM doesn't apply the brakes now and then. The only inherent limit for a Narration is that each player can take one combat-related action (see p. 40), but everything else, such as giving descriptions, roleplaying, and taking non-combat Tests, is up to the player giving the Narration. The Narration ends when the player decides it ends, such as on a nice cliffhanger for the next player to riff off of. Every player should have an equal amount of time in the spotlight, however, so if one player's Narration seems to be taking an exorbitant amount of time in comparison to other players, it can suck some of the fun out of the game, especially if some- one's been waiting for their Narration for a long while. If one player is going on for too long and not showing any signs of letting up any time soon, feel free to exercise




your GM authority to have the player wrap it up-or in the worst instances, you may declare that the Narration is over right then. If that player has not yet taken their combat-related action by that point, then the action is forfeited-clearly, the character was busy with too many other things to get in an attack.

BUILDING UP INSTEAD OF TEARING DOWN 
Shadowrun: Anarchy works best when everyone around the table listens to one another and builds on the sto- ry elements that players and gamemasters introduce. Sometimes, players or GMs might be tempted to use their Narrations to circumvent problems introduced by another player, or to cut off storytelling branches that they do not find appealing. Alternately, players might use their Narrations to heap difficulties on one or more other players, constantly throwing obstacles at them or neutralizing their abilities while letting themselves off easy.
   All of these go against the spirit of collaborative sto- rytelling, and it is up to the gamemaster to keep the sto- ry moving forward, instead of watching it do a constant back-and-forth as one player introduces plot elements that are immediately negated by another. Some strate- gies to help with this include:
• Set the tone right from the start: Make sure players know that they are supposed to build on each other's ideas, not tear them down, at the outset of the game with a quick review of how the game works.
• Plan on how to work other players' suggestions into the story: When looking over a Contract Brief before a game, consider ways that NPCs suggested by the players might be worked into the story-different roles they could fill in the larger plot. Then, when a player introduces a new NPC, you can smoothly integrate them into the storyline.
• Intervene when players move to negate other players' contributions: If one player introduces, say, a traffic pileup on the
interstate in front of the players, then another player has some air spirits swoop in to quickly clean up the rubble without it affecting the story, that's the time to gently intervene and suggest that the players let the wreck become part of the story, rather than have it canceled out. Intervening quickly will help make sure players listen to one another rather than work at cross-purposes.
• Ask questions tied to newly introduced story elements: As discussed in the Ask Good


56	CONTROLLING ANARCHY



Questions section (p. 58), a directed and specific question can help focus a player's thoughts about how to respond to a newly introduced element. The way the question is phrased and the tone of voice the gamemaster uses can help build excitement for the new story elements.

ENCOURAGING PLAYER OPTIONS 
Sometimes a player will keep using the same high-dam- age spell or the same highly effective weapon turn after turn. While this repetition is not against any rules, it may end up with one or more characters dominating the game to the detriment of other players. Also, perform- ing the same action repeatedly doesn't add a lot of story interest to what is at heart a game that focuses on story- telling. If the players tend to simply spam the same spell or weapon or Skill every single Narration, here are a few options to encourage them to try something different.
   Target Tokens: Any time a player repeats an action more than once in consecutive Narrations-firing the same gun without moving, casting the same spell, etc.- then that player earns a Target Token. These can be any type of marker, but they should be easy to differentiate from Plot Points. Once a player has earned three Target Tokens, the GM can cash those in for a +3 modifier to an NPC's action against that player. Target Tokens do not carry over from one combat to the next.
   Cooldown: Before play begins, the GM can decide that certain actions have a cooldown period. An action that has a cooldown period simply means the player may not perform that same action on two consecutive turns. This represents a Gear item needing to recharge, a heavy weapon that has a complex reloading system, a spell that needs a lot of energy and concentration to cast, and so on. If a player with a cooldown action wishes to perform that action again in the next turn, they must spend a Plot Point to ignore the cooldown requirement.

SMOOTH TALKIN': INTERACTIONS
 BETWEEN PLAYERS 
Due to the pass-the-microphone nature of Shadowrun: An- archy, players might wonder how much they are allowed to interact with each other during another player's Narration (See Passing the Microphone, p. 55). After all, the person giving the Narration essentially has the microphone, so interrupting that player would be considered rude, neh?
   Here are a few guidelines for handling player interac- tions during a player's Narration.

CONTROLLING ANARCHY	57


YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS! 
If a player has a great idea or suggestion for advancing the story, but it's not their turn, they can spend a Plot Point to interject and offer their contribution, essential- ly pausing the current player's Narration. This contribu- tion, be it a small detail or a large one, should be short, limited to one or two sentences max, and then the cur- rent player can continue their Narration.

ROLEPLAYING BANTER 
During a player's Narration, other players are encour- aged to roleplay their characters if and where appropri- ate, such as by responding to a question or adding to a discussion. Players should feel like they can participate in general roleplaying banter when it's not their own Narration, but the GM should strive to prevent any one player from stealing the limelight from the player who is giving their Narration. For a more freeform option to roleplaying, see Talk Time below.

TALK TIME 
For most Scenes and Turns, each player giving a Narra- tion one at a time will work best, as it will keep the story moving, give people a chance to be creative on their Nar- ration, and also provide a structure where people can use Plot Points. Sometimes, though, the turn-based struc- ture might interfere with the flow of conversation when runners are doing some group activity, like meeting with a Mr. Johnson, questioning a witness, or engaging in other activities where the whole group might want to participate in the conversation. In these circumstances, the GM can declare-or players can request-Talk Time, where the turn-based Narration structure is temporarily suspended while players engage in free-wheeling con- versation. However, once the conversation gets beyond mere talk and into Tests-like when someone starts a serious Negotiation and Intimidation-it's time to let the story proceed through turns again. If Talk Time was requested during a player's Narration, that player can ei- ther choose to continue their Narration or opt to let the next player pick up from there.

I COULD USE SOME HELP HERE:
 OFFERING HINTS 
Sometimes players might get stuck on their Narration and not really know what to do. This can come from inex- perience with the Cue System or the Shadowrun universe




in general, lack of confidence in their role-playing abili- ties, or any number of other factors. If a player is having trouble coming up with something for their Narration, they should first look to their Cues, Skills, Gear, Contacts, and so forth. Each character sheet has a wealth of options for a Narration. However, if none of those seem to spark any ideas, the player can request outside help, or another player can offer to step in and assist.
   GMs can use the following options to help a strug- gling player.

ASK GOOD QUESTIONS 
One of the strongest things gamemasters can do to help shape Narrations and inspire ideas is to ask a good ques- tion to start off the Narration. Rather than simply saying "It's your turn" or asking "What do you do?", GMs can use questions as a prompt to help players focus on what they can do and how they might respond to the situa- tions around them. Consider these strategies that can help generate questions that inspire action:
• Offer a quick summary of events directly affecting the PC: Something like "The ceiling of the underground lake is crumbling, your smuggler friend is urging you to get onto his submersible, and angry merrow are emerging from a flooded tunnel. How are you going to save your hoop?" can help players focus on matters of particular urgency that need their attention.
• Remind them of plans they have made or goals they need to accomplish: Players sometimes get so caught up in ongoing events that they lose focus on their larger goals, so reminding them of what they're supposed to be doing can help them move in a way that will keep the story on track. "How are you going to get past the security desk so you can infiltrate the corp exec's office?" or "You've located the gang's hideout-how are you going to approach the people inside so you can find the leader?" are examples of this approach.
• Focus on particularly novel or interesting twists that you or other players have introduced: This approach both gives players something interesting to focus on and rewards players for introducing compelling concepts during their narration. These questions can be something like "A strange blue mist just appeared over your head. What does it feel like to you?" or "Some 405 Hellhounds just rolled up next to you while you were cruising south. Want to shake them, ignore them, or something else?"


58	CONTROLLING ANARCHY




• Prompt them with ways they could add a potential twist: This doesn't mean suggesting specific plot twists, but rather suggesting possible areas where players could add something interesting. These questions could be something like "The stairway leads to a dark basement. What's hidden down there?" or "The exec's been acting nervous this whole time, and she looks like she has something to say. What is she going to tell you?"

OFFER A CLUE 
Cues for what to do next can come from the GM or from other players.
   From the GM: A struggling player can pay a Plot Point to ask the GM for some additional detail that might shake loose some ideas. The GM then provides a one- or two-sentence detail for the current events, and then it's all up to the narrating player.
   The hint the GM gives doesn't necessarily need to come from what is outlined in a Contract Brief. The best hint prompts are those tailored to what is currently hap- pening in the game. For example, if a player is in a room and can't decide what to do, then a good GM hint might be, "There's a spot of drywall that looks newer than the surrounding drywall," rather than some hint pointing toward the Contract Brief 's ultimate goal. A prompt like this works better for the sake of immediacy than an an obscure clue trying to prod the story in the "correct" di- rection. (See Jumping the Tracks below.)
From Another Player: If another player sees a char-
acter struggling with a Narration, that player can spend a Plot Point to offer a one- or two-sentence detail as a prompt, in the same manner as outlined above. The GM may not spend a Plot Point to do this, only other players.

JUMPING THE TRACKS:
 HANDLING STORY DERAILMENT 
The Cue System is all about telling a story, with each player building off what the previous player has added to the tale. The GM starts the story by using the Contract Brief as a guide: the Mr. Johnson's Pitch, the Setting, and the Scenes under Enemies/Obstacles all inform the GM as to the direction the story is initially intended to take. But what about those times when the players use their "micro-gamemaster" powers to make a Narration that swings the story in an unexpected direction that's completely opposite what the Contract Brief outlines? One of the strengths of the Cue System's style of story-

telling is that going off-rails from the as-written story is a feature, not a bug. Keeping that in mind, here are two approaches for handling a story that has jumped off the track. Depending on the situation, you may employ one or both of these options in the same game session.

BRING IT BACK AROUND 
As the GM, you might feel that your role is to keep the story focused on what's written in the Contract Brief, and that's perfectly fine if that's the way your group wishes to play. But even when you as the GM are trying to en- sure the story stays on track, player ingenuity, creative tangents, luck of the dice, and a number of other factors can potentially disrupt the story flow you intended. Mi- nor derailments or subplots are to be encouraged due to the underlying improv nature of Shadowrun: Anarchy, but the major derailments, such as the ones that turn the story in the complete opposite direction, will often require some GM direction to steer back around.
The best method to bring the story back to its main
focus is to first let the major derailment play out around the table until it comes back to your own Narration. (You may always spend Plot Points to affect the game before then, but doing so in such a blatant way may telegraph some of the secrets you are trying to keep under wraps.) You can then use your Narration and NPC actions (if any) to subtly align the story back toward what is written in the Contract Brief. Remember, though, that if you essen- tially override or nullify what another player has done, that player may get upset if the creative story develop- ment or awesome action they came up with is ignored or discarded out of hand, so if possible, try to work the de- railment idea into the story direction that is outlined in the Contract Brief. This route preserves the direction of the story while also acknowledging that the other play- ers' story accomplishments matter to the game.
   For example, say one of the previous players killed the big bad NPC that the Contract Brief says is supposed to be the main villain of the piece. There was a big tussle on a suspension bridge, and the player shoved the NPC over the side and watched the lifeless corpse float on the ocean below. As the GM, you could easily invent some way to explain how this NPC didn't really die-you really need this NPC for a later scene!-even though the previ- ous player's Narration was pretty specific, but going this route would essentially discard that player's story idea. A better way to bring the story back around to match the Contract Brief would be to let the death occur but then later introduce a new NPC who is either a relative or a close associate of the killed NPC, someone who in- tends to continue the deceased's agenda as outlined in the Contract Brief.

LET IT RIDE 
If your group is not terribly concerned with playing out a specific story, the best method for handling a major story derailment is to simply sit back and let it stand, no matter how much it throws off the direction of the written story.
   Unless a player sneaked a peek at the Contract Brief the group is playing, the GM is the only one who will actually know what is outlined in it, so none of the other players will ever know the story has gone too far off script. Depending on how far the story has strayed, it might even be beneficial to simply toss the Contract Brief as written and make a few
notes on the fly for potential outcomes of this new story direction. Unless the new direction renders the Contract's written Objectives invalid or infea- sible, the Objectives can still serve
as a guide for what direction the story might go.
   Once you've decided what parts of the Contract Brief to dis- card or keep (if any), then you can simply sit back and see where this new story goes. Letting it ride is a great way to discover unexpected story directions that could po- tentially lead to a multi-session campaign. Listen to the players- they will help shape the new sto- ry, with possibly only minor push- es from you.


LETTING THE LEAD FLY: COMBAT OPTIONS
There are a lot of ways to get maimed or killed in the Sixth World. If you are looking for some options to make combat a little faster, easier, or more survivable, here are some helpful options.

FALL BACK! 
If the players are on the verge of having multiple char- acters Killed in Action or Knocked Out and they've al- ready spent their allotment of Plot Points to keep them- selves up and fighting, the best solution may be the hated retreat.




   At the end of a round of Narrations, if all players agree, they can end the Scene. Any Plot Points remain- ing are forfeit (except those belonging to the GM, who receives an additional Plot Point). Additionally, the play- ers cannot receive any Plot Points on their first two Nar- rations in the next Scene.
   If the players failed to achieve any objectives in that Scene, then in addition to the restriction above, players will have a temporary maximum of 3 Plot Points (in- stead of the usual 5) for the duration of the next Scene.
JUST NEED A BREATHER 
When using Cue System-style storytelling, the characters are likely to see their fair share of scrapes and bruises. Because of this, if the characters charge from one Scene to
the next against tough NPCs with- out stopping to take stock of their condition, they're liable to get themselves killed pretty quickly.
   In order to keep the game moving along at a brisk pace- even if the characters had to fall back because they were al- most Killed in Action or Knocked Out-after each Scene, characters can automatically repair half of their damaged Armor or heal half of one Condition Monitor track for free, rounding up. All remain-
      ing damage must be recovered by normal methods, such as spending Plot Points, casting spells, or using medical or
repair abilities.

THEY'RE JUST MOOKS! 
There are many instances in stories where the protago- nists lay down the hurt on a slew of mooks or hench- men that are all taken out in one fell swoop. While this shouldn't be embraced very often in an RPG setting, as that approach would most likely make an evening's gam- ing a tad too boring, the GM should be willing to em- brace this type of scenario every now and then. Perhaps a character rolls an incredible surplus of hits on a combat roll, or maybe the player provides a fantastic Narration that is wonderfully creative and causes the whole group to explode into laughter. Whatever the instance, don't be afraid to let the "wall of mooks" go down when it feels right and makes that game all the more memorable. However, this option should be used sparingly.

 CHARACTER CREATION 
This book has a bunch of characters for players to pick up and jump into the shadows with, but one of the fun things about role-playing is designing characters just the way you want them and then watching them grow into awesome forces of nature. Or at least into people capable of surviv- ing the drekstorms the Sixth World relentlessly conjures.
    The following rules provide a framework for creat- ing a shadowrunner. As with all aspects of Shadowrun: Anarchy, the framework is light and fast and designed for players to playfully and enjoyably create a character sheet that reflects the style they want to embrace in a game. If you don't like where your character is going at any time during the process, feel free to back up and start down the path that'll make it the most fun!

FOLLOW THE STEPS 
Download and print out the blank character sheet from shadowruntabletop.com and proceed through the fol- lowing steps to create your shadowrunner:
1. Create a Character Theme (Character Name)
2. Choose Game Level
3. Choose Metatype
4. Decide if your character is Awakened or Emerged
5. Assign Attribute Points
6. Assign Skill Points
7. Add Shadow Amps
8. Add Qualities
9. Assign Armor


10. Select Weapons
11. Select Gear
12. Create Cues
13. Create Character Background
14. Final Tweaking

1. CREATE A CHARACTER THEME 
Imagine you're a casting director for your favorite TV show, and you've got a selection of walk-on characters you've got to fill for a new episode, characters who need to be cool and vibrant, even if they're only on-screen for a few minutes.
   As you review the script you run into a list of concise character descriptions: male, late twenties, stoic and very tough, doesn't talk much; woman, early thirties, al- ways smiling, with a devil-may-care attitude; male, teen, with a brooding anger that he fails to leash more often than not; and so on. In the role of casting director, you'll use those descriptions to find the right actor to convinc- ingly fill that role in the episode.
   In a similar fashion, as you work to create a shadow- runner, you need to find a short and flavorful descrip- tion of the theme of your character. Do you want to play the juiced-up street samurai who follows a code and only fights for causes she believes in? Or do you want to play a shaman who sees the spirit world as a harmonious place that the urban sprawl of metahumanity is quickly ruining with pollution and greed? Or perhaps you'd rath- er be the brainy cyberdeck whiz who feels she's stuck in a world of imbeciles and who can hack any Matrix sys- tem on the planet without a single milligram of magic?


FORCES OF CHAOS	61




   Anything's possible-the only limits come from your imagination. Well, and some of the practicalities of the game world, which might keep you from having a shad- owrunner from Venus or something, but let's stay fo- cused. Pick something that's interesting to you and that will inspire you to do amazing and challenging stuff as you play, and it will work out.
   With that in mind, jot down a few descriptive words that outline your theme. Don't hesitate to fill a page if you're still trying to feel your way to what you want, knowing you're going to toss most of the concepts by the wayside as you zero in on your mark. Additionally, if you're still floundering a little, feel free to find out what everyone else in the group is playing and find a niche to fill: Is there room for a sarcastic, brooding, older doc- tor as a mentor-type for an up-and-coming tyro on your team? Jump in and see if that role fits you.
   Once you've got your theme, you'll use that as the framework to help you make the decisions involved in the rest of the process.

CHARACTER NAME
While this step appears at the start of character creation, it can actually happen any time during the process.
   Some players will find they've already got a character name they've been hanging on to for just such an adven- ture; the name itself drips with theme and will imme- diately lend itself to a certain flavor. If you say "Sledge," most people will likely have a preconceived notion of where the character creation process is going to take them: a burly, chromed-to-the-gills street sammie who can pound foes into the pavement.
   Other players, however, may find they don't have a good name in mind and instead, even with a theme, may have to travel most, if not all, of the creation pro- cess before the right name presents itself. And of course don't forget to trawl through the sample characters for names that might spark your imagination to craft your own unique take on a given theme.

TAGS
While not a requirement for character creation, every sample character sheet includes a short list of one-word Tags, and these Tags are carried throughout most of the sections of the book. They're designed to give a very quick look at the theme/style of what you're looking at. In the case of characters, Tags define what a character is, as opposed to how a character would react in a given situation (see Create Character Background, p. 69).



2. DETERMINE GAME LEVEL 
The player group should decide what kind of overall power level the characters in the game will have. Are you interested in playing jumped-up gangers looking to carve a name for yourselves, or do you want to play veteran shadowrunners with rap sheets longer than the the polluted Mississippi River? Or maybe you wish to play somewhere in the middle, shadowrunners who are more seasoned than outright n00bs but still have a lot to learn? The selected level determines what each character will allocate to certain aspects of their shadowrunner.

GANG-LEVEL GAME
   A gang-level game provides the following charac- ter-creation stats:
• Attributes: 12 Attribute points
• Skills: 10 Skill points
• Amps: 6 Shadow Amp points
• Weapons: 1 weapon (ranged or melee)
• Gear: Armor, 3 items, 1 contact

STREET RUNNER GAME
   A standard game provides the following charac- ter-creation stats:
• Attributes: 16 Attribute points
• Skills: 12 Skill points
• Amps: 10 Shadow Amp points
• Weapons: 2 weapons (one ranged, one melee)
• Gear: Armor, 4 items, 2 contacts

PRIME RUNNER GAME
   A prime runner game provides the following charac- ter-creation stats:
• Attributes: 20 Attribute points
• Skills: 14 Skill points
• Amps: 14 Shadow Amp points
• Weapons: 3 weapons (any)
• Gear: Armor, 5 items, 3 contacts

3. CHOOSE METATYPE 
   It may seem like a simple choice, but your character's metatype can shape several aspects of your character. Choose one of the following metatypes and apply the following bonuses:
Human: +1 Edge, +1 Skill point
Elf: +1 Agility, +1 Charisma
Dwarf: +1 Strength, +1 Willpower
Ork: +2 Strength
Troll: +2 Strength, +3 Armor circles, -1 Skill point

4. DECIDE IF YOUR CHARACTER IS AWAKENED OR EMERGED 
Some abilities in the Sixth World are only available to people who qualify them. If you're not Awakened, you can't access mana to do amazing things like cast spells, summon spirits, or enhance your physical abilities. If you're not Emerged, you can't access the Matrix solely with the power of your mind, meaning you do not have access to technomancer abilities. If you want access to either of these areas (but not both-characters cannot be both Awakened and Emerged), you have to select that

option in this step and pay the cost. Check either the Awakened or Emerged box on your character sheet, and deduct 2 Shadow Amp points (see step 7)

5. ASSIGN ATTRIBUTE POINTS 
Based on the chosen game level, each player has a num- ber of Attribute points to assign to the five Attributes: Strength, Agility, Willpower, Logic, and Charisma. (Edge is a special Attribute that is covered under the Select Shadow Amps section, p. 65, and so is not improved in this step.) Each Attribute point assigned equals one point for that Attribute, and characters begin with all Attributes set at 1 (since 0 is not a rating that function- al metahumans can have in any Attribute). That means that if you want a Strength of 5, you assign 4 of your allotted Attribute points to Strength to increase the base rating of 1.
   If you have a metatype bonus to an Attribute, you add the bonus to how many Attribute points you spent on that Attribute to determine the final Attribute value. For example, dwarves gain a +1 bonus to Willpower, so if you spend 4 Attribute points on Willpower, you will have Willpower 6 (base rating of 1 + 4 spent + racial bo- nus 1 = 6).

   Your character's theme can help you decide how many points to assign to each Attribute. The only restric- tion on Attribute point allocation is that no Attribute can exceed its maximum for your character's metatype. The Attribute Maximum table shows the maximums for each metatype.

CONDITION MONITOR
The Strength and Willpower Attributes have a direct cor- relation to the damage tracks on the Condition Monitor. Use the following rules for determining the character's Condition Monitor:
   Physical Damage Track: The Physical Condition is based on the Strength Attribute. Divide Strength by two, round up, and add eight, and that's how many boxes you get on your Physical Condition Monitor. Arrange those boxes in rows of three, with leftover boxes in the bottom row. So Strength 4 gives ten boxes-three rows of three and a bottom row of a single box.
   Stun Damage Track: The Stun Damage Track is based on the Willpower Attribute. As with Strength in the Physical Damage Track, divide Willpower by two, round up, and add eight. Then make a condition monitor with three boxes per row, and any leftover boxes on the bot- tom row.
6. 
ASSIGN SKILL POINTS 
Based on the chosen game level, each player has a num- ber of Skill points to assign. Peruse the list of Skills on page 32, and choose a few of them that match your char- acter's theme. Characters may only start with five skills. They should also select a Knowledge Skill (see below), which does not have a rating and thus does not cost Skill points.
   Once you have chosen your Skills, distribute your Skill points until all of them have been assigned. There is nothing to be done with leftover Skill points, so you might as well use them all. Each Skill point assigned equals one point for that Skill. For example, if you want a Close Combat of 4, you assign 4 of your Skill points to Close Combat.
   Skills must be assigned a minimum of 1 point, and the maximum value of any Skill during character gener- ation is 5 (6 if you are doing a Prime Runner game).
   Once all Skill points have been assigned, use the Skills list on page 32 and note which Attribute links to each Skill.
   Knowledge Skills: These Skills represent things your character might know in-game. They can encompass a variety of subjects, including languages (e.g., Japanese, the elven language of Sperethiel, the ork language of Or'zet), interests (e.g., sculpting, online gaming, trog rock bands), or professional knowledge (e.g., police pro- cedure, local gang info, corporate culture). Knowledge Skills are not listed in the Skills list on page 32-you can create your own, so use your imagination. Since they are so broad, they are not given a rating, and they typically do not add to dice pools-they should be used to further storytelling possibilities, rather than as a mechanism for tests. Check out the sample characters starting on page 73 for more examples of Knowledge Skills
Specializations: If you wish to narrow the focus of a
Skill with a Specialization, choose the Skill, determine the Specialization's focus, and then apply the bonus dice to that Skill for that specific focus. For example, a Sor- cery Skill Specialization can be a specific type of spell (Combat, Illusion, etc.), a Close Combat Specialization


OF CHAOS




can be a specific weapon, and a Hacking Specialization can be a specific Matrix action, such as accessing ma- glocks. A Specialization to a Skill allows the player to roll two extra dice when using that Skill.
   Choosing a Specialization for a skill costs 1 Skill point. Players can begin with only one Specialization, but further Specializations may be obtained through Char- acter Advancement (see p. 70). Skills with a rating of 1
cannot have a Specialization.

7. SELECT SHADOW AMPS

position.
   Like many aspects of character creation, the best Shadow Amps are those that fit your character's theme, but don't hesitate to add a seemingly mismatched Amp if it might give your character that unique feel you're looking for.
   You can add Shadow Amps in two ways, either by choosing one you like from the list on p. 202 or by cre- ating one of your own. The maximum number of Shad- ow Amps a character can have is six. Empty slots can be filled by purchasing new Amps during Character Ad- vancement (see p. 70). Existing Amps can be upgraded or replaced (also detailed in Character Advancement, p. 70).
   The following rules cover how to add Shadow Amps to your character:

A. DETERMINE BASE COST
Whether you use a premade Shadow Amp or create one yourself, you must first determine its total cost. Consult the list of Shadow Amps and types on page 202, and decide

† May require approval of the GM and other players; see
p. 207 for listing of effects.


1	+1 attack
2	+1 attack, 1 Plot Point per Scene
3	+1 attack, 2 Plot Points per Scene
‡ These are not cumulative. Choose the effect for the chosen level.
what type of Amp you wish to add or create. Then consult the Shadow Amp Cost Table to find the base cost for that slot type. This is the minimum Shadow Amp point cost for the slot and a simple, functional description of what the Shadow Amp does; no rules text, such as those described in the Added Effect list in the table are included in the base cost. That means the initial selection of a Shadow Amp is useful for story purposes, but not much else.


FORCES OF CHAOS	65




   If you're fine with the basic description and aren't concerned about adding other effects, then you can stop there. Add the Shadow Amp to your character sheet and then continue to spend points on other Amps. But if you really want it to be useful, the Amp should do some- thing. Which we'll cover.

B. DETERMINE ADDED EFFECTS
Standard Shadow Amps with simple descriptions can function like Cues during your Narration: for example, a spell or adept power with an interesting description might give you a unique idea on how to tackle a problem, or a piece of cyberware might let you approach some- thing from a different angle. However, if you're looking for more than just standard mojo for a Shadow Amp, that's where added effects come into play.
   Added effects allow you to customize Shadow Amps beyond a simple description. If you want to include an added effect, consult the Added Effects section of the Shadow Amp Cost Table and add the appropriate cost to the base cost of the Shadow Amp. Once you have added all of the desired effects, determine the total cost and allocate that many Shadow Amp points to that Shadow Amp.
   If an added effect turns a Shadow Amp into a weap- on-an implanted cyberware weapon, for example-make sure to list that in the Weapons section of the character sheet. See Select Weapons, p. 68, for more detail.
EXAMPLE
   At the Street Runner level, Ash has 10 Shadow Amp points to spend on Sledge. She wants Sledge to have some gleaming chrome on him, so she starts with a cyberarm, which costs 1 point. She wants to be able to reroll two dice on Close Combat attacks, so she adds that ability, which costs two points. The cyberarm as a whole costs 3 Amp points and 1 Essence.
   Next she adds some cyberspurs to the cyberarm. The effect she wants is to allow Sledge to do either Physical or Stun damage in unarmed attacks. This Amp adds an Amp level and increases the Essence cost of the arm.
   Now she turns to the eyes. She selects a single effect for the eyes-the ability to ignore vision modifiers. This costs 2 points, and once again, she loses a point of Es- sence.
   Finally, Ash is well aware that speed kills, so she needs something like wired reflexes. Or something that is wired reflexes. She gets it at the second level to get +1 attack and
+1 Plot Point. Again, the price is 3 Amp points.
   Altogether, Sledge has spent all 10 Amp points and has lost 5 points of Essence, making his Essence 1. He would have trouble casting magic, but Ash wasn't planning on having him do that anyway. The loss of dice on healing tests might make life difficult for Sledge, but Ash figures she'll deal with it by making sure Sledge takes out oppo- nents before they hurt him too much.
C. 
DETERMINE ESSENCE EFFECTS
   Each character starts with an Essence of 6, and cyber- ware or bioware Shadow Amps reduce a character's Es- sence according to the Shadow Amp's Essence cost listed in the Shadow Amp Cost Table. A character can never have an Essence of 0 or lower; 0.5 is the lowest allowable Es- sence. If a player wishes to add a Shadow Amp whose Essence cost would reduce the character to an Essence of 0 or lower, that Shadow Amp cannot be purchased.
   A character's Essence value has the following effects on gameplay:

ESSENCE EFFECTS...........................................................

6-5.5	No negative effects.
5-3.5	-1 modifier on Magic-related Tests and
attempts to heal this character.
3-1.5	-2 modifier on Magic-related Tests and
attempts to heal this character.
1-0.5	-3 modifier on Magic-related Tests and
attempts to heal this character.

D. NOTE SHADOW AMP LEVEL
Count up the points spent on each Shadow Amp, and write that number in the upper left corner of the Shad- ow Amp box. That is the Shadow Amp level, and is need- ed to calculate upgrade costs in the future.

E. CONVERT LEFTOVER SHADOW AMP POINTS TO EDGE POINTS
Each character starts with an Edge of 1. If a player does not spend all of their allotted Shadow Amp points, the remaining points are added to the player's Edge Attri- bute (max 6). For example, if a player in a Prime Runner game chose to spend only 12 of their available 14 Shad- ow Amp points, the remaining 2 points would be added to their Edge, increasing it from 1 to 3.
EXAMPLE
   Sledge doesn't have any leftover Amp points, so his Edge will stay at one. Ash could opt to have the cyberarm make only one reroll on Close Combat tests, saving a point there are transferring it to Edge, but she decides she wants the rerolls.

8. ADD QUALITIES 
Each player must choose two positive qualities and one negative quality for their character.
   Positive qualities generally add additional dice to a Skill, though they can also offer a myriad of other posi- tive gameplay bonuses. Negative qualities generally sub- tract dice, but they can also double penalties, or cause a number of other negative gameplay challenges.
   When choosing qualities, you can either pick one from the sample character sheets or you can create one.
   To create a quality, choose whether you want it to be positive or negative. When providing a dice bonus, positive qualities add two dice; when providing a dice pool penalty, negative qualities subtract two dice from on Skill, Shadow Amp, or other effect. You can get more creative if you want (see listed qualities on p. 204 for other examples), but adding or subtracting two dice is the most straightforward way to make a quality.

9. ASSIGN ARMOR 
Most characters do not have natural armor, so if they're not wearing armor, they get no armor protection. Trolls, though, are thicker and sturdier than other metatypes, so they get +3 circles as a metatype bonus.
   
If you want more armor than your natural armor- and if you want to survive more than a few minutes, you do-you want some wearable armor. Armor comes at three levels-6 circles, 9 circles, or 12 circles. To obtain armor value 9, you do not need to do anything but choose one of the basic armor types and add it to your gear list. To choose armor that gives 12 circles, subtract one skill point from your selected skills-if you are choosing to specialize in heavy combat protection, then you are less effective in other skills. To choose armor with 6 circles, give yourself a bonus Skill point to compensate for your decreased armor (if you're going to travel armor-light, it's clearly because you have some other skills to rely on). Some armor might be selected as Shadow Amps to give bonuses besides straight protection. For example, chameleon suits can give bonus dice to Stealth Tests, or faewear may give bonuses to Con tests. These pieces of armor should be selected as Shadow Amps, with a base armor value of 9. In these cases, the armor value may be increased by 3 for an additional Shadow Amp point, to a
maximum of 12.
Basic armor is as follows: Synthleather jacket: 6 Actioneer Business Clothes: 6 Armor clothing: 6
Armor vest: 9


FORCES OF CHAOS	67



Lined coat: 9
Armor jacket: 12
Body armor: 12








10. SELECT WEAPONS 
Characters can choose at least two starting weapons, not counting their Unarmed Combat stats or weapons granted by Shadow Amps. We recommend each player take one ranged weapon and one melee weapon, but this may vary, depending on the character's theme. If a player wishes to start with more than two weapons, the player group must approve this.
   As with the Cues in a later step, selecting your weapons can be fun. You can simply copy the weapons from one of the sample character sheets, using the sample sheets like a shopping catalog. However, unleashing the lawbreaker inside can be far more enjoyable: just make up whatever cool name you want-the more cyberpunk-sounding, the better! What about a napalm arrow? Write that down. Or have you seen a weapon in the pages of a Shadowrun book and always wondered what name it might have? What about a monofilament cat o' nine tails? Write that down too. When it comes to your weapons, consider the theme of your character and embrace it.
   To determine the stats of a newly created weapon, look at the gear catalog or find a comparable weapon in the sample character sheets, and use the Damage value and range brackets of the existing weapon. (Additional range brackets can be found in under the Weapons section of Anarchy and Shadowrun, Fifth Edition on p. 206.)
Regardless of whether you choose existing weapons
or create your own, just remember that your character can only ever have a total of six weapons.



11. SELECT GEAR 
A player may choose up to four items of noncombat Gear and two Contacts.
   As discussed under Using Gear (see p. 44), Gear in Shadowrun: Anarchy is not a set of hard rules and does not come with attached mechanics. Instead, they almost act as their own Cues, propelling the action forward without dropping into the minutiae of what exactly a piece of equipment weighs, what it does, and so on.
   Use the few lines on the Gear section to accentuate the theme of your character, providing items you feel will be fun and enjoyable during game play. You don't even have to know what some of them do ... one or two could just be crazy, fun-sounding names that you'll fig- ure out on the fly. Or take a look at items on the sample character sheets and choose something that sounds like must-have equipment that you think might pull your hoop out of the fire at some point.
   A chosen piece of Gear does not necessarily have to match your character's role, but a decker will likely get more use out of a piece of computer-related gear than a computer-illiterate shaman would. Also keep in mind that you're probably better off not worrying about mundane items such as ammunition and spare magazines. Anarchy doesn't concern itself with track- ing how many bullets are left in a gun, so make sure you reserve your gear slots for more important items. Which means items that present interesting storytell- ing possibilities.
   It's important to make clear that, due to the loose na- ture of these rules, it's all too easy for players to create wildly powerful/ludicrously small gear; e.g., a "pocket tactical nuclear warhead launcher." After all, "the rules didn't say I couldn't!" If your player group decides such a thing is cool and fits with what you want to see in your games, by all means allow it. But most player groups will realize that even within these rules, a limit needs to be set on the power of gear, and that limit is: Does the piece of Gear lead to a fun story for all the players? Player groups may want to police Gear during character creation to ensure it's within the limits they're all com- fortable with ... or be stuck with the GM having to say, "Yup, sorry, that nuke launcher you just spent a dozen playing sessions obtaining fizzles, spurts, and goes silent
... It's a dud. And now the spirits in the area you tried to irradiate are really pissed."
Contacts: Contacts represent a special kind of Gear,
namely the people your character knows. These can run the gamut from street lowlifes to people in corporate penthouses, and they'll be the ones your character gets in touch with when things go south, you need some in- formation, or you just need a shoulder to bleed on.


68	FORCES OF CHAOS



   You should choose Contacts that go along with your character's theme and background. For example, if your character grew up on the streets, then having an AA-rated corp exec as a Contact might be a hard sell to the player group, but a gang leader and BTL-chip dealer wouldn't be out of the question. Likewise, if you're play- ing an ex-cop, then maybe you'd have a police chief or a Knight-Errant beat cop for a Contact. That said, feel free to think outside the box, because sometimes people can know some surprising folks.








12. CREATE CUES 
As noted under Cues (see p. 35), these are phrases that can be bold statements a character might make in a giv- en situation, or can be used to spark an idea of which direction a character might leap.
   When creating Cues for your own character, use the same method you used when generating your character theme: jot down different phrases, sentences, or just saucy, juicy words that sound like something that would be fun to say during the action of the game. Then use the list to zero in on the best set of Cues.
   You can also review the sample character sheets (see p. 74) to spark your own ideas for Cues. If you're having a difficult time, feel free to use catchphrases taken from your favorite comic books, movies, TV shows, and nov- els, just tweaked slightly to make them unique to your character. For example "That was totally wicked!" could be tweaked to "That was totally killin'!"
   If you're still struggling, feel free to make the gener- ation of Cues into a party game for all those who'll be involved in a game of Anarchy. Each player can write down two or three (or more) Cues based on your char- acter theme, and then you can select some, none, or all of them. Even the craziest Cues could prove an interest- ing take on your character's personality under the right circumstances, so don't be so quick to toss the wilder concepts out.
13. 
CREATE CHARACTER BACKGROUND 
Now that your character is done, feel free to fill in some details of your character's background by using your char- acter theme as a springboard. Take a look at some of the sample character sheets to get some inspiration for your character's background information. Here are some things you are encouraged to add to bring your character to life:
   Personal Data: This represents vital statistics: meta- type, age, sex, height/weight, and any other pertinent details you want to write down.
   History: This is the meat of your character: who they are, where they came from, why they're running the shadows, and so forth.
   Personality: This represents details about how your character reacts to and interacts with various circum- stances. This can be as detailed as you want to make it.
   Dispositions: Like Cues, your character's Disposi- tions should flow from how you're building your theme. Even the description you used when generating your theme could be turned into Disposition statements.
   As previously noted under Tags (see p. 62), Dispo- sitions define how a character will react given various stimuli and circumstances (as opposed to Tags, which define what your character is).
   Again, review the sample character sheets, or ask for suggestions from your player group if you're struggling to define this aspect of your character.

14. FINAL TWEAKING 
Once you've written down all of your character details on the blank character sheet, review the final character to en- sure it's everything you want it to be. If you want to nip and tuck a little here and there, by all means, feel free.
Some of the places you can tweak characters are:
• Adjusting Armor up or down (make sure you pay or receive the requisite Skill Points for the change).
• Changing how a specific Shadow Amp works.

   Such tweaking should be kept within reason. For example, you shouldn't change Attribute or Skill rat- ings up or down, as that has far too great an impact on the mechanics of gameplay. Make sure Attributes and Skills are where you want them to be, and take another look at Cues and Dispositions to make sure they convey the character the way you want them to be. With that, you're ready to roll!

 CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT 
Players may advance their characters by accumulating Karma earned during game play and translating points of Karma into improvements on their character sheets.
There are three ways to earn Karma:
• Gameplay: Every time a player finishes a Contract, their character earns the amount of Karma described in the Contract Brief for meeting particular objectives.
• Gamemaster: At the completion of a Contract, the gamemaster may award a bonus point of Karma to any players who they felt demonstrated extra cleverness, humor, bravado, or other positive qualities in the course of their Narrations.
   
In all cases, the players should remember to mark down their accumulated Karma points in the appropri- ate spot on their character sheet.
   After noting accumulated Karma points after a suc- cessful Contract, players can then spend that Karma in the following ways:
• Improve an Attribute
• Improve/Add a Skill
• Improve/Add a Shadow Amp
• Remove a negative quality
• Improve Armor
• Buy/Improve Weapons and Gear

   To make any of these changes, using the following rules (no other aspects of the character sheet change):

IMPROVING ATTRIBUTES 
To increase an Attribute by 1 point, spend Karma equal to the chosen Attribute's new rating x 2. For example, to im- prove a Logic of 4 to a 5 would cost 10 Karma (5 x 2). Attri- butes can never exceed the maximum for the character's metatype (see the Attribute Maximums chart on p. 64).
   If Strength or Willpower are improved, remember to adjust the Condition Monitor (see Condition Monitor,


70	FORCES OF CHAOS




p. 64) and melee weapon damage (see Close Combat
Damage Bonus, p. 41) appropriately.

IMPROVING/ADDING SKILLS 
   Improve Skill: To increase a Skill by 1 point, spend Karma equal to the Skill's new rating. For example, to improve an Engineering Skill of 3 to a 4 would cost 4 Karma. The maximum value for Skills is 12.
   Add a new Skill: If you have an open Skill slot on your character sheet, you can buy a new Skill at rating 1. (If you do not have an open Skill slot, you may not buy a new Skill unless the player group agrees to allow additional Skills.) To buy a new Skill, choose a Skill from the Skills list on page 32 and pay 2 Karma to get that Skill at rating 1.
   Add a specialization: You may add a specialization to a Skill that does not already have one. To do so, pay 2 Karma, choose the specialization's focus, and note a +2 modifier for that Skill. Skills with a rating of 1 cannot add specializations.

IMPROVING/ADDING SHADOW AMPS 
   Improve a Shadow Amp: First, determine how you want to improve the Shadow Amp. Consult the Shadow Amp Cost Table on page 65 and choose the effect you wish to improve. For example, you could add the ability to reroll 1 failed die, or you could increase the damage reduction from 1 circle to 2 circles. Shadow Amps may only be improved one level at a time. For example, you cannot add 2 dice rerolls to a Shadow Amp that doesn't already have a die reroll effect, and you cannot increase the damage reduction from 1 to 3 circles.
   Once you have determined the new effect, reference the small number in the corner of the Shadow Amp's box (the total level of the Amp). To improve the Shadow Amp, increase its level by 1, pay an amount of Karma equal to the new level, and add the chosen improvement to the Shadow Amp. For example, if a Shadow Amp has a listed level of 4, increase its level to 5 and pay 5 Karma for the improvement.
   Add a new Shadow Amp: If you have an open Shad- ow Amp slot on your character sheet and can afford the Essence cost (if any), you can buy a new Shadow Amp for that slot. (If you do not have an open Shadow Amp slot, you can spend Karma to replace an existing Amp, but you may not add a new one unless the play- er group agrees to allow additional Shadow Amps.) To buy a new Shadow Amp, see Select Shadow Amps, p. 65, to determine the level for the Shadow Amp you wish to add, paying Karma equal to each level you pur- chase. That is, if you buy a new spell Amp, pay 1 Karma

for that first level. Then, to add a new power, pay 2 more Karma for that level, making 3 Karma total.
   If you wish to add a Shadow Amps that is listed on another character sheet, the cost for that is represented by a small number in the corner of the Shadow Amp's box. Once you have determined the cost, pay the re- quired Essence cost (if any) and an amount of Karma equal to the Shadow Amp's cost, plus an amount equal to each level below it (for example, a level 3 amp would cost 3 +2 +1 = 6 Karma.

REMOVE A NEGATIVE QUALITY 
If your character is constantly getting into trouble because of their negative quality, you can choose to spend Karma to remove it from your character sheet. But ridding yourself of a character flaw isn't easy. To remove a negative quality, pay 6 Karma. Detailing the story of how you overcame the negative quality to your group, just to add to the ongoing narrative of your player and their team.
   Note that this option should be used with caution. While removing the negative quality may help a charac- ter mechanically, it removes some great storytelling op- tions, and telling fun stories is what Anarchy is all about. Be cautious about taking away opportunities for charac- ters to overcome challenges!

IMPROVE ARMOR 
Some armor improvements might done using Shadow Amps, but in some cases characters might simply want to improve their Armor rating. This is a simple matter of spending 3 Karma for each 3-point improvement in Armor. Note that worn Armor can never increase to a rating of more than 12.

BUY/IMPROVE WEAPONS AND GEAR 
Sometimes the weapons and Gear you have just aren't enough to get the job done, and you might need to find more ways to geek people and keep yourself from get- ting geeked. Due to the nature of the Cue System, the Shadowrun: Anarchy rules do not worry about tracking nuyen, the Sixth World's most common currency. Play- ers are welcome to roleplay the exchange of funds when acquiring new items, but this is not necessary. Instead, acquiring or upgrading new toys simply requires an ex- penditure of Karma.
   Buy new Weapons and Gear: At any time, even during a game session, a player may spend 2 Karma to acquire one of the following: 1 weapon, any 2 Gear items, or 1 Contact.


FORCES OF CHAOS	71



   Customize a Weapon: To customize a weapon, choose a weapon effect, and spend 3 Karma. Here are some example weapon upgrades:
   Accuracy: Add the reroll of one failed die. (Examples: laser sights, integral smartgun system)
   Lethality: Increase Damage by 1. (Examples: flech- ette rounds, explosive rounds)
   Range: Decrease the range penalty of a single dis- tance by 1. A weapon with a "-1" in a given range bracket will change to an "OK." Range brackets with a "-" cannot be changed. (Sample customizations that might accom- plish this: nightvision scope, high-caliber rounds)
   Further sample weapon effects can be found on the characters included with this book.

 COYDOG	
ELF STREET SHAMAN 


BACKGROUND 
Coydog was born to a tribal Sinsearach elf and a Sal- ish-Shidhe soldier, and she inherited traits of both. She inherited her mother's gracefully pointed ears, long limbs, and elven knack for charm. Her father made her a fighter.
   While her brother, Scout-Who-Kills-Six-Times, em- braced the streets of Seattle and fell in with the First Nations gang, the streets had another plan for Coydog. Her affinity for wind and weather erupted rather mag- nificently when trouble came calling one day, and before long she found herself studying with a shamanic men- tor, Four-Paws-Laughing, on Council Island. As a follow- er of Coyote, she knew she could never settle for life as a corporate wage mage, and simple talismonger work or reagent hunting would be too boring for her. That left the shadows.
   As a promising beginner to the Seattle shadowrun scene, Coydog has developed a name for herself already for innovation and talent. Falling in with-and forming an integral part of-"Myth's Crew," she's a creative, ver- satile shaman who'll only get better with experience. Coydog's a casual hooder, a runner who's in the shadows to do good, not just do good for herself. The young elf sometimes finds herself at odds with more mercenary runners, but so far her good nature and potent air spir- its have seen her through, even when her morals might otherwise make her job more difficult. She chose the shadows because they offered her freedom, not wealth; only time will tell if she's able to walk her path as freely as she'd like.

 GENTRY	
HUMAN COMBAT DECKER 


BACKGROUND 
Gentry may not be as good as he thinks he is, but then no one is as good as Gentry thinks he is. For a while, he had a rough time of it, but he's found steady work in Ms. Myth's crew in the Seattle shadows. Born a human in the elven "wonderland" of Tír Tairngire, Gentry's street name was a cruel joke; the Gentry are the lowest class of citizens there, and his handle served as a constant re- minder that his rounded ears would keep him from ever climbing society's ladder. Working as a street-hacker and a data courier-including for rebel terrorists-Gentry's luck eventually ran out and he found himself tried for treason and locked up in a Tír prison.
   He found his way out through an unexpected angle: professional sports. The hyperviolent game of urban brawl spread into the Tír, and they desperately needed to fill rosters. Convicts who seemed dangerous enough to put on a good show but harmless enough not to es- cape were offered work-release programs, and Gentry fit the bill. Pyscho-conditioned to ensure game-field obedience (and as further insurance against escape at- tempts), he leaped, vaulted, shot, and hacked his way to an early release-and an unceremonious dumping on the streets of Seattle.
   His head may be a mess of crossed wires-literally as well as metaphorically-but Gentry's no slouch in the Matrix. He's athletic enough to handle the night-to-night hurdles of being a shadowrunner, smart enough to take care of the tech issues the life throws his way, and solid enough in a fight to hold his own. Bad luck has caught up with him a few times, and so has a habit of running his mouth and fawning over nearby elves, but he's found a niche with Ms. Myth and has started to make a name for himself in the Emerald Grid, Seattle's Matrix.

 HARDPOINT	
DWARF SECURITY RIGGER 


BACKGROUND 
It's not easy being a "halfer" in one of the Sixth World's most traditional, conservative Japanese megacorps. Born to meta-mixed parents, Hardpoint was never really giv- en a fair shake; discriminated against because of his An- glo heritage, treated unfairly due to being a metahuman, and repeatedly passed over for promotion and approval, his wasn't an easy childhood.
   As a younger man he excelled in the corporation's structured athletics programs (dominating his weight class in non-combat-augmented grappling), scored top ranks in corporate academia, and stayed firmly in step with Mitsuhama's strict corporate culture. Even- tually, he earned a spot only as a reserve combat rig- ger in MCT's fabled security corps. He was eventually driven from the corporation when an arranged marriage proved to be one insult too many; begging his father for forgiveness, he left the family business behind and jumped into the shadows.
   Despite letting his hair down (and his beard out), Hardpoint has retained more than a few habits from his MCT days. Loyal to a fault, he'll never let his team down or betray a trust (which means he won't make an attack directly on MCT if he can help it). He's also a pragmatist, whose confidence is well-earned but grounded in reality. If Hardpoint can't finish a job, he won't take it. His team- mates invariably appreciate his attitude as much as his ability. He's got a mellow nature that really only changes when his friends are hurt or someone is extraordinarily wasteful or cruel. Inefficiency still gets under his skin a little, though, and Hardpoint often works hard trying to improve his machines.

 MS. MYTH	
TROLL FACE 


BACKGROUND 
Ms. Myth's father was a janitor who tried to teach his baby girl a work ethic, a willingness to clean every cor- ner of a filthy building for honest pay, and corporate loy- alty. Her mother was a restaurant server, who did her best to teach her daughter that sucking up paid well, long hours meant fair pay, and service with a smile beat service with good food.
   Instead, Myth learned that sometimes you've got to get your hands dirty, that janitors have access to every nook and cranny of a secure facility, and that smiling made people more scared of you than frowning did.
   She ran the streets, rather than letting the streets run her. Hustling, plotting, and planning were Myth's keys to urban success, and she only fell back on her trollish brawn when all else failed. Smarter than she looks and more charming than anyone ever expected, Myth's spent years navigating the Seattle shadows, playing multiple sides in the great game; sometimes working as a fixer, other times as a runner, and even others as a corporate freelance troubleshooter on mid-term retainer.
   Myth will lie-with a smile-to almost the whole world to see a job done smoothly and professionally, with only a few exceptions. She's always honest and real- istic when wooing an extraction target (kidnapping gigs aren't her style), and she'll never, ever, lie to her team. Myth's team knows she'll do what's best for them and shoot straight, and in turn Myth knows they'll always give her their best. And the best part is that she picked them herself, so she knows their best is pretty good.

 SLEDGE	
ORK STREET SAMURAI 


BACKGROUND 
Life's tough in the Underground, so you've got to be tougher. Every young ork coming up in the dark knows the rules, and every one of 'em knows which ones can be broken. Sledge grew up hard and he grew up fast, feeling in his gut that the world was a bigger place than what he saw, and that he was meant for bigger things than Skraa- cha gang colors and fighting over turf. The Underground wasn't the only option out there; Seattle offered deep, dark, shadows, too. Shadows that would leave him more room to grow than tunnels.
   Sledge's penchant for combat paid off in a big way, and instead of drinking away his first windfall or gam- bling with it, he went for a surer bet. Slowly but sure- ly, he invested his low-level profits back into himself, getting stronger, tougher, and faster, so he could take on bigger challenges. The ork's especially proud of his arms-and he regularly has street docs work on them- and his fusion of chrome, courage, and consistency has made him a force to be reckoned with.
   The backbone of Myth's crew, Sledge is as dangerous in close as he is at range. With a few trophies taken from high-profile gigs already-like his favorite Raiden auto- gun or his trademark Neil the Ork Barbarian sword-he's making a name for himself as a reliable, dangerous pro- fessional in a reliably dangerous profession. His code of honor is short but dear to him, and bloodshed's waiting for anyone who tries to make him cross a line.

 ALYOSHA DUSKA	
DWARF SPIRIT WHISPERER 


BACKGROUND 
Organized crime isn't a life you choose so you can be a good parent. Alyosha knows that well. His father was Vory v Zakone, Russian mafia, and while Alyosha didn't feel much love as a kid, he learned a lot about the world's underbelly. The most important thing he learned was that the Vory wasn't for him. Crime itself was neutral, though. Laws were made up by metahumans and en- forced, or not, by other metahumans. Spirits taught him a different path.
   As a youth, Alyosha was visited by the Bear spirit, his only comfort in a house of violence and insecurity. The spirit taught him to live in cooperation with the world, not dominate it. It taught him how the spirit world works, how spirits speak to one another, and that his family is much broader than just blood. Bear was Alyo- sha's father, and Alyosha was Bear's shaman.
   Because of his upbringing, Alyosha felt ill participat- ing in violence. But the spirits around him did not feel the same way. Spirits would fight for him, if he asked. And he had a gift for asking. Sometimes spirits said, "no," but that was okay. Alyosha respected them and their wishes-there are always other spirits around, willing to help. Bear taught him that.
   Alyosha pays the rent doing what he does best. As a Spirit Whisperer, he summons spirits for hire. Need a spirit to spy on a husband or wife? Protect a child? Clean your house? Alyosha is your shaman. But Alyosha loves the jobs that bring him back into the underworld, re- minding him that this world's laws are nothing more than human words. In the end, he's always cared more about what the spirits have to say.

 BIT-BUCKET	
ORK DECKER 


BACKGROUND 
Bit-Bucket didn't get into hacking because he was a shy kid who loved electronics. He didn't get into hacking be- cause he wanted to avoid the gang brawls common to his Ork Underground upbringing. He got into hacking for the simple reason that he understood that in the Sixth World, that's where the money is.
   As a youth (by the name of Grralk), he and his friends did some minor smash-and-grabs in the Tourist Highway, and he was dissatisfied to walk away with a few pieces of fruit, or some cheap commlinks that he couldn't get anyone to buy for more than twenty nuyen. Tens of thou- sands of nuyen were flowing through the Highway each day, and at that point he could only figure out how to grab the smallest fraction of it.
   He wasn't having any of that drek. The money was there, all around him, he just needed to figure out how to get his hands on it. He made his stealing more targeted, getting himself the tools he needed to learn how the Ma- trix worked and how he could break it. He learned how it was different from the meat world and how it was the same-how sometimes, bursting in with a flurry of noise and tumult was as good a strategy as any. He didn't have a teacher or mentor or anything; instead, he learned from books, from blogs, and from trial and error. He made a lot of mistakes, bricked a lot of 'links, but by the time the Matrix revisions of 2075 kicked in, he was ready to hack into a corporate database and have a new cyberdeck delivered to a PO box he rented. He didn't pay for either the deck or the mailbox.
   Bit-Bucket's mark is an ork fist in a studded glove com- ing right at you, which is how he hacks. He is bold and showy, usually very willing for his targets to know who he is and what he is doing to them. He has developed a kind of one-sided rivalry with legendary shadowrunner Bull, known as "the best ork decker you never met," mainly because every time people found out he was an ork and a decker, they mentioned Bull, and Bit-Bucket decided he needed to show who out-ranked whom when it came to ork deckers. Primarily this involved hacking into Bull's restaurant and trash-talking Bull on Matrix forums, so nothing serious. Mostly, it's a way for Bit-Bucket to raise his profile, which he likes to do whenever possible.

 BORDERLINE	
HUMAN GANGER RAZORGIRL 


BACKGROUND 
The Redmond Barrens define Borderline's existence. For most people, Redmond is somewhere to avoid at all costs. For her, it's home.
   Growing up in the Barrens isn't all bad. There were times when the radiation over Glow City looked beauti- ful at night, romantic even. Or on Black Mondays when the Anarchist Black Cross would supply free medical care and food for everyone. Even the gangs sometimes stopped fighting so they could see doctors. But the hap- piest day of the year for Borderline was Halloween. That was when the Halloweeners would tear through Red- mond, wearing wicked costumes, and turn the world upside-down.
   When Borderline turned twelve, she marched over to the Jackal's Lantern and declared her desire to join the Halloweeners. It didn't turn out how she expected-but it made her strong. Strong enough to steal food for her siblings. Strong enough to deal with anyone who threat- ened her. Strong enough to blackmail a street doc into upgrading her body. After ten years of running with the 'Weeners, she was the baddest razorgirl in Redmond.
   She stands on the edge of two worlds: the broken world of the Barrens and the world outside. Running the shadows has broadened her perspective. She still has ties to the Halloweeners, but her world has expanded beyond them. Shadowruns now take her all over Seattle, but she always comes back. Redmond is in her blood. It's where her family is. It's where her name means some- thing. It's who she is.

 CHROME BISON	
TROLL STREET SAMURAI 


BACKGROUND 
The child who eventually became Chrome Bison spent years complaining to the elders about not having trideo. Her pleas for gaming consoles always fell on deaf ears. Whenever she begged her parents to let her try fast food, the answer was always the same. "We are not like the rest of the world. We are survivors and caretakers. That world you long for is a world of parasites."
   She didn't know how much she would miss that shel- tered childhood until she lost it forever. Rebellion took her into the "real" world. There, she learned about rac- ism. She learned about injustice. She learned troll skin often stopped bears from hurting her, but it didn't stop explosive rounds. A good Samaritan with a fake SIN and a DocWagon contract got her out of there and paid for her cyber. Now, her body could stop explosive rounds. That was her introduction to the shadows. The price for her new 'ware was becoming a shadowrunner until she paid off her debt.
   Once she had, she went back home, only to find that her tribe was gone, and in its place was a massive mining operation. The miners said her tribe had just moved on. She knew better. This corporation had been trying to buy their land for years. Now it looked like they just took it. Maybe if she had been there, she could have protected them. But she wasn't. Indulging her own desires instead of helping her people survive was a mistake. One that she will never repeat. She'll die before she lets anyone down again.

 DAKTARI	
DWARF STREET DOC 


BACKGROUND 
Steve Kiley thought he had it all. He had a great job with DocWagon, the premier private emergency medical care provider on the North American continent, if not the planet. He got to have an adventure every single day as his high-threat response team roared in to rescue an- other subscriber. Most importantly, he got to save lives, which since his youth had been his entire raison d'etre. He lost patients sometimes; all doctors do. But his suc- cessful treatment percentage was a credit to his corp, and his supervisors had recommended him for a promotion.
Naively, he thought that meant something.
   On a high-threat response job into gang territory in Redmond, Steve had just worked a miracle. Their client was a shadowrunner who'd gotten in way over his head fighting the Death Heads, one of the newer gangs in the area. He'd taken a very big knife very close to the heart, and he had come perilously close to bleeding out before the knife was removed and Steve's magical treatment closed the artery and patched the hole in his lungs. As Steve and his partner were loading their patient into the waiting chopper, they came under fire from the gang. Steve was struck squarely in the chest, and while his body armor stopped the round, he was knocked out.
   He came to sometime later and realized two things. First, the DocWagon High-Threat Response motto, "No one left behind," was a complete load of drek. Second, he was surrounded by more than a dozen gangers, most of them with varying degrees of injury. He traded his ser- vices to Fusion, the gang's leader, for the chance to leave Redmond intact. When he finally got back to a more civ- ilized part of Seattle a few days later, he found that he'd been declared dead by DocWagon. Not feeling too char- itable toward them anyway, he took that as a sign that it was time to move on. Since then, he's run a shadow clinic back in Redmond, where his skills are sorely need- ed, and taken the occasional contract as medical support on actual shadowruns.

 FOURTH	
ORK REPORTER 


BACKGROUND 
Funny thing about the truth: Though it may take a thou- sand years, it will always find a way out. Fourth (as in the Fourth Estate) has dedicated herself to helping it escape into the wild at a substantially accelerated pace.
   Likely as not, she wouldn't be out to make the lives of the rich and powerful so miserable now if that car hadn't hit her girlfriend. If the uber-rich corp exec's punk kid had stopped to render aid, Ashley might not have bled out in a Tacoma gutter. If Knight Errant had taken the death of a SINless ork girl seriously, they might have found out that she wasn't the first one to be hurt or killed at this punk's hands. It hadn't taken much to fig- ure it out; a few questions here, a drink or two there, the occasional bare-your-tusks threat, and all the answers started coming together.
   She'd taken everything that she'd learned to the Knights, and they did nothing. That was when she'd met Reyes. He was a reporter, looking up crime blotter stuff, sifting around for a story. He told her the way to defeat people like this corp kid wasn't through the rigged legal system, but through public outcry. One person couldn't get the system to change, but if they could create enough public outrage, the Knights would have to do something to quiet them down.
   It worked. He could smell the story himself, and he offered to do it for her, but she knew she had to do this herself. Ultimately, he showed her how to work sourc- es, gather info, and put out a story that pushed people to action. The first one took a couple of weeks to put together; the follow-ups took months. What her early work lacked in grace and sophistication, it made up for in passion. She made life a living hell for the punk, and it became a sufficient embarrassment to Knight Errant that ultimately they had to do something to make the protests stop. Justice was served.
   Then the public forgot about it. By that time, though, Fourth had found another truth to set free. And then an- other. Her life's work unfolded before her.

 FUSION	
ORK RIGGER/GANGER 


BACKGROUND 
Fusion didn't plan on ever leading a gang. She was just an ork who loved her bike. That is, until she met Stubbs. She'd always had a thing for dwarfs. When he came rid- ing around Downtown on his chromed-out street-cy- cle, she'll admit that she swooned a bit. When he came around the next day asking about bikers looking for money, she was in. When he told her he was putting a gang together to show the Ancients who was boss, she was first in line.
   Her bike got chromed out to match the gang's col- ors, and she ended up spending all of her ill-gotten gains making her bike faster and tougher. A chrome skull tat- too, neural upgrades so she could rig into vehicles and drones, a wiz bike, and a cute bad boy dwarf. Life didn't get any better.
   The gang became the Death Heads. She was in charge when the bosses were away doing their shadowrunner thing. But they weren't around when the Ancients came around looking for payback. That was when she real- ized that having a go-gang wasn't just about being a bad motherfragger on a wiz set of wheels. Lots of her closest chummers fell to the Ancients, and the rest high-tailed it to Redmond. The other gangs in the barrens weren't as mobile or organized as the Ancients, so that's where they laid down roots. And she told Stubbs the gang was hers now. She'd earned it.
   The first year that Fusion and the Death Heads spent in Redmond was dedicated to upgrading their bikes for the broken Barrens terrain. The next year was spent dom- inating the roads. Now, she does whatever she wants.

 HAWK	
HUMAN STREET SAMURAI 


BACKGROUND 
His time in the UCAS Army taught Joseph Simmons a lot of things. It taught him how to shoot. It taught him how to work with a unit. It taught him to trust his fellow soldiers to do their jobs, because they were trusting him to do his. It taught him to lead, and to be patient. It took a street punk from Seattle and made him part of some- thing bigger. It taught him to be better.
   It also taught him that the brass further up the chain of command would stab you in the fragging back and not think twice about it. After ten years of faithful ser- vice, they exercised the early termination clause of his enlistment contract, and he found himself back on the streets of Puyallup. One afternoon, he was sitting at the counter of a diner, wondering how he was going to pay for the meal he'd just ordered and realizing that there weren't many career paths in the private sector for well- trained killers. He realized that he was lost without a unit around him.
   An older-looking ork sat down next to him at the counter and asked, in a raspy voice, "You got any skills?"
   That changed everything. There might not have been a lot of call for his skills in the private sector, but there was a great need for men with leadership skills in the shadows. Most shadowrunner teams don't have some- one who can bring the best out of each member, and that was something at which he excelled.
   So now he has a second career-and a new sense of purpose.

 JINN	
ELF BRUTE FORCE DECKER 


BACKGROUND 
Jinn grew up in Istanbul (the Free City of Constanti- nople, if you care to be official about it). As Sufis, his family found that Istanbul was a haven of tolerance for their beliefs compared to many of its neighboring states. Jinn grew to appreciate the diversity of his cosmopolitan home, growing more attached to culture and luxury as he grew. At an early age, he became fascinated with high fashion, so he learned how to navigate the Matrix, just to experience more of the culture he lacked. Seeing the male and female models in outrageous clothing inspired him like nothing else.
   While attending a fashion show sponsored by Shi- awase, young Jinn met Empress Hitomi Shiawase. The empress was in Istanbul to spread goodwill on behalf of Shiawase Corporation and seeing a photo opportunity, she struck up a conversation with a local child-Jinn. Without knowing who she was, Jinn blathered away about the latest fashions and how he had to hack certain Matrix sites just to view feeds from Milan. Curiously, this impressed Hitomi, who gave Jinn his first cyberdeck (before the new Matrix regulations) and offered him a job at Shiawase when he got older.
   Jinn never forgot that meeting, and his love for fash- ion and decking now included a passion for Shiawase products. Jinn never did take the job offer at Shiawase, as he discovered his gift for hacking allowed him to make nuyen far easier than being a wageslave. He loves the finer things in life, and for him, that means superb fashion, Shiawase tech at his fingertips, and forcing the Matrix to do his bidding.

 KIX	
ELF RAZORGIRL 


BACKGROUND 
Puyallup's got some of the meanest streets in Seattle, and Seattle's got some of the meanest in the Sixth World. Kix came up from there, deep in the Puyallup Barrens, near enough to the elven ghetto of Tarislar to have ugly neighborhood race relations, but not deep in the heart of the pointy-eared district where her metatype would bring safety in numbers. She had the worst of both worlds, and it didn't take long until she knew the only way out was to stop taking it and start dishing it out.
   She started with knives, the gutter-cheapest way to escalate a confrontation wildly past the level of an open hand or closed fist. Her quickness made her a natural, and her eagerness to inflict damage married nicely to her physical ability. It wasn't long before she opted for implanted blades-she'd never be disarmed or disadvantaged again-and once the augmentations started, they didn't stop until she was the leanest, meanest thing on the streets.
   She eventually settled on Kix as a street handle- short for Kickstand, since aside from her slicing and dic- ing, she's mean on a bike-and it didn't take her long to build a name and a rep. Scorning the romantic notions of honor and etiquette that street samurai cling to, she's purely a Barrens-born pragmatist. She maintains no il- lusions of glory or nobility to her chosen calling-a job's just a job, a fight's just a fight, and someone's life is just nuyen waiting to be earned.

 KNOX	
DWARF STREET FIGHTING ADEPT 


BACKGROUND 
Growing up without a SIN meant that Knox never had access to the finer things in life. When most normal kids were playing with trideo games, watching the latest Des- ert Wars, or catching up with the latest Fragging Uni- corns album, she was getting bullied by the other poor kids in her neighborhood. Being a dwarf wasn't easy in the Ork Underground, but it certainly made her tough. She learned that if she backed down, the fights kept coming. But when she fought back hard enough, even if she lost, kids stopped wanting to throw down.
   That lesson served her well until she Awakened, and everything changed.
   Now, her body was alive with power. Instead of be- ing the victim, she chose big targets and picked on them instead. It was never enough. This was what she knew. Survival. Brawls. Blood. This is what made her feel alive. She'd never have to lose again. That's how she found the mana pits, pit fights where all of the fighters used magic. She finally had a challenge.
   While fighting in the pits, a Mr. Johnson offered her a job making more nuyen than she'd ever seen. He said her skills in brawling were just what he needed. After joining up with him and bruising the people he wanted bruised, she found that punching people for money was great. Her dream job! She still fights in the mana pits when runs are scarce, and she thrives on those moments where she can indulge her aggression and get paid to do it.

 NINETAILS	
HUMAN INFILTRATION EXPERT 


BACKGROUND 
Life on the streets isn't easy, but it is simple: Take what you can, hold what you need, it's yours if you can keep it. It's true of syndicates and gangs battling for turf, it's true of hungry kids fighting over a devil rat corpse to eat, and it's true of everyone in between.
   Ninetails? Ninetails is an expert on the "take what you can" part.
   She started small, like most Barrens-brats. Simple cons, quick distractions, smooth palming tricks. Pick- pocketing escalated to snatch-and-grabs, snatch-and- grabs to burglaries, and burglaries-well, burglaries be- came something of a specialty.
   Ninetails cuts through mundane security like a mono- filament knife through a soy patty. There aren't many locks she can't handle, many alarms she can't disable, many safes she can't crack. She's practiced at social engineering to get past what guards she can't avoid, and she's lean, mean, and augmented enough to handle anybody who forces the issue. With a little help for deep Matrix work or magical security, there aren't many places she can't get into, and she charges a premium for her elite skills.
   As a specialist in intrusion and infiltration, she's a valu- able asset for a shadowrunner team that can hire her. Tails isn't the ruthless killer some shadowrunners are. Her fo- cus is on getting in unseen, retrieving a lucrative target, and escaping without notice. Violence is the last resort of the artless, and lethal violence just isn't her style.

 RAIDER	
ELF COMBAT ARCHAEOLOGIST 


BACKGROUND 
Ernie Talloak had one goal as a kid: Get the hell out of Tucumcari. It was hardly a unique goal; most every kid in Tucumcari had the same idea. For most of them, that involved getting some sort of job with a corp, maybe even the Pueblo Corporate Council itself. For Ernie, it meant studying his butt off and getting a scholarship to the university in Santa Fe, studying his butt off there, and then getting a nice, cushy corp job.
Long fascinated by the lore of his Navajo heritage, Er-
nie gravitated to history and archeology, and he excelled there. His professors took an interest in him, and soon he was out in the field with them, learning on-the-job in a way that was impossible in the classroom even with the best of Matrix simulations.
   It was on one research expedition to an Anasazi cliff dwelling that Ernie discovered, completely by accident, a hidden entrance to a previously unknown set of cham- bers. He and his professors spent the next several days carefully examining the contents. He helped catalog ev- erything, helped carefully pack relics for transport back to the university for further study-and then watched as they were shipped, not to the university, but to a PCC warehouse. They were to be sold off. No one would learn more about their heritage from them. Ancient mysteries would not be unraveled. They would become trinkets in some corp exec's private collection. Nothing would be learned. So he complained, vocally, to his professors.
It was at about that point that they tried to kill him. Narrowly escaping death, Ernie found his career in ac-
ademia abruptly ended. The shadows were there to catch him, though. Since then, he's been from the desert sands of Egypt to the jungles of the Yucatan. There was even a trip to Antarctica once. He's made many discoveries since he began. Some of them have wound up with the corps, but most have made it where they belong: In a museum, where they can provide knowledge and enlightenment.

 RASPBERRY JAM	
HUMAN ARMS DEALER 


BACKGROUND 
Raspberry Jam is a second-generation gun runner. And not just guns. He's the kind of guy who can get you any- thing you want as long as the payment is good. His dad was never in the picture, so his mother became a wild- ly successful black-market dealer in Seattle. She was a sweet woman who never looked like an arms dealer, so she got away with murder, often literally. His momma taught him early never to trust anybody, but everybody deserves courtesy. As a result, Raspberry is extremely likable, even when he is trying to kill you.
   He's always cracking a joke and is the first to say yes to something wild. His mouth never shuts off, and often he makes up words when his brain can't keep up. Business is just about the only thing that Raspberry Jam takes se- riously. All the rest of the world is just a plaything, some- thing to be enjoyed with the wealth he has earned. When it comes time to make a deal or get a job done, however, the smile stays on, but the gloves come off.
   Growing up around mean, vile people, Raspberry learned to have a shut-off valve for his heart. He has one somewhere deep inside, though, and he loves to have people love him-a real life-of-the-party type. But he also thrives on danger. That's why, although his primary source of income is liberating illegal goods into the free market, he runs the shadows to get his adrenaline fix. It's not a bad way to test his product out, either.

 RAZZLE DAZZLE	
ORK ILLUSIONIST 


BACKGROUND 
Rebecca doesn't remember a time when she didn't want something more. A little more food. Softer sheets. Shini- er toys. Growing up near the Shattergraves, in the wrong part of Chicago, though, didn't make that very likely. She was smart enough to figure that out, however, and after she Awakened, she found her way out.
   Magic was the escape she'd been longing for. No more ugly apartment or hateful home life for her; even if she didn't have pretty things, she could make the things she had look pretty. And that was enough, at least at first. Soon, she discovered that people were willing to pay her to cast her spells, and that was the real escape. She'd found her way out of the Shatter- graves and into the shadows, and now she could ac- tually buy-and occasionally steal-the soft and shiny things she'd always craved.
   Her greatest skills revolve around illusions, and that serves her well in the shadows. She is frequently de- pended upon to provide a distraction so that the rest of the team could pull off the job. Growing up in the slums of post-Bug City Chicago, a dislike of insects both magical and mundane had been de rigeur in daily life; for Rebecca, it'd grown into active fear. Ironically, channel- ing this fear into some of her distractions has become a trademark.
   Shadowrunning has given her the chance to travel the world and live in comparative luxury. But she still wants a little something more.

 REESE FRENZY	
ORK ROCKER/FACE 


BACKGROUND 
Most shadowrunners find themselves rebelling against the system because it's the only thing they are good at. Well, that or because the nuyen is good. But not Reese Frenzy. Reese has everything someone like him could want. He was raised in a decent home, did all the right things growing up, and got a degree in biology from the University of Denver. As the front man for a Den- ver-based Sprawlpunk band, he has the respect of his peers. When he's not doing that, he works at a hospital as a nurse, using his degree in biology for something use- ful. So why would that kind of person run the shadows? Injustice. Somewhere deep inside, a voice tells him that everything this world says is good-isn't. No mat- ter what the corp news says, corruption and oppression based on race, gender, metatype, or what-have-you con- tinue strongly today. Education liberated his mind, and now his conscience rages to free others. Now, when an opportunity comes up to do some bad for a good reason,
he lives out the lyrics of his songs on the streets.
   Having heard of shadowrunners all his life, he con- sidered them gangsters, hostile, and dangerous. And to be fair, many of them are. But he also met some runners who were not in it for themselves. They were in it to change things, take down the corps, give people a fair chance at a free life. And that resonated with him. Now, when an opportunity comes up to do some bad for a good reason, he takes the lyrics in his songs and lives them out on the streets.

 ROSE RED	
ELF MYSTIC ADEPT 


BACKGROUND 
Not many people can say that shadowrunning is a moral step up from their last profession. But most other people didn't traffic in human beings. Together with her sister, Rose Red started off as a victim of trafficking herself, and she became one of her pimp's biggest money-makers. Along the way, she awakened and used her newfound powers to force others into bondage like she was. She became so good at it that she eventually killed her owner and took over the business.
   Rose Red was notorious as a high-end madam for wealthy business people and politicians, first in Toron- to, then branching out to Seattle. She eventually found her sister and convinced her to come work for her. Rose gave her sister the best jobs with the most influential clientele, while hiring gangers to kidnap other young metahumans to fill the ever-growing needs of her other clients. Everything was going according to her plans un- til one of those politicians was seen with her sister, and her sister became a liability. Unable to stop her sister from being killed to serve a politician's reputation, Rose fell apart. She walked away from her life and lived on the streets of Toronto for months, refusing to talk to anyone or use her powers.
   Someone saved her life by inviting her to a local meeting of neo-anarchists. There, she discovered she had been a tool of the system. Broken and used by the powerful, only to be so brainwashed that she did the same to others. Without shaming her, they invited her to be a part of the solution, not the problem. Taking note of her powers, they referred her to Black Star, a group of neo-anarchist shadowrunners who work for the people, not the money. She's never looked back.

 RUCKUS	
TROLL BRUISER 


BACKGROUND 
Ruckus knows better than most how unfair the world can be. The first strike against him is that he's a troll. Sure, there are lots of trolls who make it just fine in life, but the others-the majority-don't. Second, he was abandoned as a child by his parents, who just didn't want a troll as a kid. Third, he was adopted by a nice old woman who was poor-which made him poor as well. Poor trolls without parents have very few options for gainful employment, and so Ruckus didn't bother to try. The one thing he had going for him was that he was big, even for a troll. And that meant others saw him as valuable. Dropping out of school just seemed to make sense when he wasn't really good at it anyway, and there were always gangers willing to pay him just to back them up. Every once in a while, Ruckus had to hit someone.
After a few months, that was his primary job.
   His fortunes changed one day when the cops busted down his door and, although he didn't resist, they beat him and shot him in the leg. He didn't do what he was accused of, but after having his leg amputated, he spent a few months in jail anyway. The only thing he got out of it was a used cyberleg. When he got out, Nana Rick- ard, who had taken him in as a child, had died. Ruckus was hungry, angry, and aimless. He slept underneath the city streets until a ganger he used to know said he need- ed backup for a shadowrun. Ruckus didn't know what a shadowrun was, but after he got paid, he decided he wanted to do more of them.

 SHADES	
HUMAN FORMER COMPANY WOMAN 


BACKGROUND 
Shades never wanted to go independent. She never wanted to be uncertain about her next nuyen transfer. She never wanted to be a shadowrunner. She wanted to fight for her company and protect people.
   Raised by corporate citizens to be a corporate citi- zen, she had her whole life planned out for her when she was young. She stuck with her plan, excelled in her studies, and worked her way up the corporate ladder out of uniformed security and into the high-responsi- bility life of being an executive protection specialist. Ex- ec-protect came with perks, upgrades, and high-profile assignments, everything she wanted-until the time a job went wrong.
   She took on one assignment too many-a mission as a proactive bodyguard, a corporate assassin-and even- tually ran out of loyalty to her employers when they sent her after the wrong target. Shades took her skills, her attitude, and her augs and hit the road. Now working for the highest bidder, she brings a professional's touch and a keen eye to any team.
   Augmenting her combat abilities with subtle recon drones, Shades serves a new master now: herself, by way of the almighty nuyen. She understands that in the shadows her reputation is of tremendous importance, and she's determined to put her nose to the grindstone in order to climb this new ladder. She's well aware of the importance of teamwork and is well-equipped to make the people around her better. She figures a little profes- sionalism goes a long way, and friends can make all the difference in an ugly business.
   Maybe here she can still fight for something. Maybe here she can still protect people.

 STRIDER	
DWARF PARKOUR ADEPT 


BACKGROUND 
The Puyallup district of the Seattle sprawl is loaded with hard-luck stories, but Strider has steadfastly refused to be one of them. Born a dwarf to human parents, she had to deal with prejudice and disappointment from an early age. She took solace in sports programs at school as she grew up, and in spite of her "stumpy dwarf legs," she ex- celled at track and field events. It was in school that she discovered the sport of parkour, or free-running, a disci- pline that turned obstacles into advantages. She fell in love with the sport and the philosophy almost instantly. Running away from home at an early age, she made her living at odd jobs. She discovered her adept abilities while evading an assault, and immediately saw uses for them. She had always loved to run, and she knew that many people needed small packages and documents de- livered quickly. She went into business for herself as a
freelance courier.
   Business was tough at first. Being SINless, more than a few of her deliveries were for less-than-savory types looking to save a few nuyen, as well as avoid licensed couriers and their reporting requirements. She didn't let that stop her, though, and she gained a reputation. One of the deliveries she made was ordered by the troll face called Ms. Myth, who hired Strider to deliver a pack- age to private investigator Jimmy Kincaid. Both Kincaid and Ms. Myth were impressed with her, especially after learning that she had taken down a pair of thugs hired to steal her package while en route to Kincaid's office. Both have continued to use her services, and Ms. Myth has even contemplated taking her out in the field with her team.

 THUNDER	
HUMAN VIGILANTE 


BACKGROUND 
Born in the Clear Lake district of the Houston sprawl, Erica Krieger lived an uneventful, comfortable life as a child. Her parents both worked for AresSpace. When she was five years old, the Second Matrix Crash happened, and in the chaos, both of her parents were killed in an accident. Having no other family that anyone was aware of, Erica was taken in by Sid Morrow, a friend of her fa- ther. He raised her as his own daughter from that day on. Her adopted brother Danny began teaching her the family business of automobile maintenance, and Sid cheerfully let her work in their shop in the Pasadena dis- trict when she was old enough. Before that happened, her sister Sophie was born. Not long after that, Erica Awakened as a mage. Her ability to fix vehicles magically
was a help around the shop.
   Sid and his wife Dinah died in a car accident when Erica was ten, and the shop was left to Danny. Erica spent a lot of her time taking care of Sophie, who had a learning disability. Years later, while Erica was running errands for Danny, several members of the Vaqueros street gang assaulted Sophie and killed Danny. The Lone Star investigation was cursory, at best, and Erica went after the gangers herself.
   She met both Leland Dunn, a former shadowrunner turned street preacher, and her mentor spirit, Dragon- slayer, on this journey. Leland taught her to fight, and Dragonslayer showed her the path he wanted her to take. Now she splits her time between the auto shop she inherited and patrolling the streets of her neighborhood, keeping the residents safe (or, at least, safer) from the gangs that plague the area.

 TOMMY Q	
HUMAN FORMER WAGE MAGE 


BACKGROUND 
Tommy's got Talent to spare-that's capital-T-Talent, the magical ability some are lucky enough to be born with. He was given great advantages from an early age: wealthy parents, magical potential, and the patronage (however distant) of one of the world's most potent forces.
But he always had a taste for shortcuts, too.
   He squandered his good fortune every chance he got. He learned things he wasn't supposed to. He flaunted his abilities and made enemies instead of allies. He cut corners to augment his natural potential. He lied, he spied, and he stole.
   Then he took everything he had and jumped to the shadows. Why live a life constrained by the restrictions of corporate rules and regulations? Freedom's where it's at! The streets are alive with magic and potential, the shadows are the way to choose your own path, and being an independent contractor is surely the path to unend- ing wealthy and glory.
   Tommy's not the easiest runner to work with, but he's good enough that most teams don't mind the chip on his shoulder. He's handy in a fight, quick with a spirit, and great at patching up an injured teammate, and arro- gance is a fair price to pay for a corporate-trained combat mage. Tommy's only going to get better over time, and he hopes his hand-picked parting gift from his former employers helps him to improve all the quicker. He's not sure what the focus is meant to do, but he knows he'll figure it out sooner rather than later. Just a few more nuyen for reagents, and he'll be on his way to real power. Just ask him.

 VECTOR	
HUMAN TECHNOMANCER 


BACKGROUND 
Nobody really seems to know what his name was before he took on the nom du guerre Vector, and he's quite com- fortable with that. He's gone to great lengths to make sure this state of affairs is so.
   Some who know him call him a freedom fighter, strug- gling to free those of his kind captured by various corps. Others skip over the niceties and call him a terrorist. Given the effort he's put into erasing his past, even his country of origin is uncertain. Those who have spoke with him be- lieve they have detected a trace of a German accent in his voice, and the Free City of Berlin would be a likely home for someone so dedicated to anti-corporate actions.
   Wherever he came from, his current home is Sno- homish, an unlikely spot for a creature of the Matrix. It gives him a break from the flood of Matrix traffic that hits him in other parts of the sprawl, plus it provides seclusion from the many corporate forces eager to track him down. He hasn't executed any major datasteals or anything-what irritates the corps are the pranks he's pulled to cause chaos in various corp hosts, and the technomancers he's freed from corporate facilities. From changing AROs advertising clothing to display the faces of child laborers who ostensibly made it (with la- bels such as "Handcrafted with care by Aqib, age 12") to messing up the augmented reality directions at the massive Center House mall so no shoppers had any idea of where they were going. That sort of thing made Vec- tor someone the corps would like to see punished, but it was freeing ten technomancers from a Mitsuhama facil- ity and four from a NeoNET facility that really got Vector on the corps' drek list.
   Far from being cowed or intimidated, Vector sees the target on his back as a call to arms and a push to do even more, to go bigger, and to make more of a splash. To some, that makes him dangerous to work with, but other runners see it s an indication that he's a kindred spirit.

 WAGON	
HUMAN COMBAT MEDIC 


BACKGROUND 
It's not easy raising a kid while you're both professional criminals, but Wagon's folks managed it. Born into the shadows and trained to run them, Wagon's a solid chum- mer who's welcome on almost any crew who's heard of him. His parents took a steady stream of low-risk, rea- sonable-reward work and ran the shadows for decades. Wagon has worked hard to build the same reputation for reliability, but only time will tell if he takes bigger gam- bles than they did.
   Most of his formal education came from street docs and black-market clinics, and he took to the work like a fish to water. He's also a heck of a shot, with a real knack for gunplay. His steady nerves and hand-eye co- ordination shine whether he's wielding a laser scalpel or a laser sight, but Wagon's most valuable asset is his even temperament and willingness to compromise. A peacemaker by natural inclination, there aren't many better at keeping a team running smoothly, being ev- eryone's friend, and providing that intangible something extra that can make a group of disparate criminals into a well-oiled machine.
   Wagon's affable nature has left a trail of contacts be- hind him, from a wide variety of syndicates and sources, which multiplies his usefulness in the shadows. He's a startlingly fast learner, a great conversationalist, and a voracious reader, and he easily picks up new skills and new friends alike. While he's at his best patching up a teammate in need, his parents saw to it he'd always be ready to run the shadows, and he's never a detriment to his team.

 WHEEZER	
TROLL GANG LEADER 


BACKGROUND 
When it came down to it, Darren Wilkes always kind of liked the streets-no ceilings to brush his horns on. He could even put his imposing physical stature to work. Pops had already disappeared, and Ma was having trou- ble feeding the twins, so he went to work doing what a troll kid from South Houston did best. He was a big, tough bastard and he scared people, and there were any number of gangs willing to employ these talents. He fell in with the Vaqueros and was soon earning his keep as the muscle for some of their protection rackets.
   Ma was willing to take the money-she was a practi- cal lady, if nothing else-but she didn't want the twins to follow their big brother into the gang. One failure, she said, was enough. So he left. He still sends money by, and she still takes it, but he hasn't seen her or the twins in years.
   He's had more than his share of conflict with Lone Star over the years. One of the earliest run-ins left him with a throat injury that led to his street name. He can't muster much volume when he speaks, and his words sound like they're coming out of a leaking air compres- sor, but he'd never been one to say much anyway, so it didn't bother him much.
   What did bother him was not getting what he thought was his due from the leaders of the gang. So he fought his way up through the ranks. For a while, he was content to be the top dog's lieutenant, but after a while, even that rankled. Everybody thought Duke would re- main king of the mountain because he was a much bet- ter knife fighter, but Wheezer was bigger, tougher, and meaner than anyone-even the survivors of his ascent through the ranks-gave him credit for. Now he rules the gang with an iron fist. This occasionally brings him into conflict with Thunder, but the two have reached an ac- cord of late. How that holds up remains to be seen.

This is our turf, chummer; you've got to pay the toll.	We settle this the Vaquero way: trial by combat.
You fraggers are in way the hell over your heads!	You have a problem with my decision, drekface?
	
Don't need the Star; we're the fraggin' law around here.	Just like I told you: You won this round, you're free to go.
Nice plan. Very subtle. You might've noticed that I don't do subtle.	You hired us to handle the guards; we're handling the guards. Go do your thing!

NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
Note that some of the "characters" here are actually crit- ters, beasts of the Sixth World with special powers that can cause havoc for shadowrunners, especially when they take up residence in urban environments. Critter Powers work similar to Spells, Adept Powers, and Technomancer Amps in that they can only be used by characters specifically des- ignated as critters, in the same way that spellcasters and adepts are Awakened and technomancers are Emerged.

THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE

POSTED BY: SOUNDER
If you're a mountain climber with any prets at all, you don't look for the easy way up a slope. You don't climb a mountain that's "kind of " high. You go big, just to see if you can. And to show the world you can take it. If you're a combat biker, you may tool around in the minors a little, making a name for yourself and putting some scratch together for a proper bike, but your sights are set on the majors. You want to show what you can do, and you want to do it at the top, in the big time. Being the best in the minors is the same as not being good enough. Seattle is the major leagues. The big time. Yeah, there are a lot of places in the world to run, and lots of challenges. Neo-Tokyo is swimming in cash, Mumbai spins East and West together into dizzy intoxication, GeMiTo seems to pack everything in the world in its vast sprawl, and Lagos finds more ways to kill you than you ever believed existed. But Seattle, the Queen City, sits on top of them all. This place is full of legends-the Ork Underground that started as an outlaw refuge and made itself into an official district of the city; Dante's Inferno, where the hottest people in the city and the hottest icons across the Matrix mingle; the Arcology Commercial and Housing Enclave, a vast, mostly empty building still trying to shake off the ghosts of its past; Glow City, a melted-down nuke plant where only the truly desperate find shelter; and many more. You can run in lots of places in the world and make a decent living (assuming you stay alive), but there's only one city where, when you tell people you've run there, they widen their eyes and sit a little straighter without knowing they're doing
it. That's Seattle.
   So, wanna run at the top? Here's some essential info you'll need to know about the Emerald City.

THE WHOLE CITY 
The way Seattle hits you depends on how you enter. Come from the air, and the first thing you notice is Mount Rainier, especially if you're coming in on a low-flying t-bird and the mountain peak is higher than you. It lords over the sprawl like an ancient Greek god; the lights and the pavement of urbanity may have stretched across the region for dozens of kilometers, but most of Rainier remains untouched. You quickly find out how vast the sprawl is, but you never shake that first impression of it being dwarfed by a massive peak.
   Come by land, and odds are you are assaulted by green. Unlike some sprawls in the heart of North America, the Seattle skyline is not a distant beacon that can be seen from any slightly elevated position within fifty kilometers. You don't see it until you are already in the sprawl, so the outlying areas hit you first. The evergreen trees, the emerald-green road signs, and (assuming you are a normal, AR-using person) the green AR overlay that tints everything. It's the color of perpetual life, which is what the civic leaders want you to think, but it also holds a longstanding connection to the color of money.
Enter by water and the first thing you see is the
purple glow in the sky as you round the western peninsula and make your way into Puget Sound. Then the obstacles move out of your way, and you see that skyline looming over the reflective water, the lights and neon looking pristine and clean from a distance. It is every urban wonderland you ever dreamed of, it holds all the possibilities in the world, and it dares you to come closer and attempt to find a flaw. You approach, because you cannot help it, even though you know that the

lights and beauty are very likely a trap, and once you're in you'll be caught in a grasp that will not easily let go.
   All of these impressions are true, and all of them are incomplete. Any single impression of Seattle is going to be inaccurate, because one impression cannot contain a city as large as this. Every type of person you can conceive of is here-unimaginably rich business magnates, master thieves, staunchly judgmental law-enforcement officers, relaxed neo-hippies, shamans looking for deposits of toxic sludge to bury themselves in, brilliant inventors, equally brilliant patent thieves, gangs looking to build power for themselves, gangs looking to burn everything down, mobsters who would shoot their own brother and sell their own mother, pimps, muggers, robbers, murderers, assassins, every possible kind of sinner, and precious few saints.
   That variety helps make Seattle the shadowrunning capital of the world. Other cities may have more devastated barrens, wealthier corporate headquarters, or more magical resources, but no city has it all like Seattle does. Its location, an isolated UCAS island surrounded by the Salish-Shidhe Council and not far from the Tír Tairngire, ensures that government tensions will always be part of the city's mix, while its North American location and historically high traffic and immigration from Asia means that all the megacorps feel they have a key population base there (Aztechnology and Saeder- Krupp may have the least claim on the city but still compete fiercely in its borders, partly out of habit). The sheer amount of wealth involved in these battles attracts all variety of organized crime. And on top of that, dragons have taken root in the city, adding to the powers attempting to claim the sprawl for their own.
   The equation is simple: bright lights of power combined with the need to perform dark, illicit deeds makes shadows everywhere.
   The money is high, the stakes are higher, so the competition is fierce. One reason Seattle shadowrunning is so dangerous is not just the array of powers lined up to double-cross or trip you up-it's also the other shadowrunners who will wait for you to show a sign of weakness and then make you pay so they can take your place on the ladder. That's the real trick of the city, knowing that any gun, even the one on the hip of your best chummer, may be pointed at you at any second. Living with that possibility is exhausting. Surviving it is exhilarating.

THE SHAPE OF THE CITY 
Like any sprawl, the underlying land shapes what hap- pens on top of it. To understand what's happening on the streets, you need to understand what they're built on.
   
Seattle is nestled between mountains on the east and the Sound to the west. The protection of the mountains and the ocean currents keep the climate mild though often cloudy. Most things about the climate tend to be gentle. Seattle has more rainy days than New York, but less total rainfall. On-and-off rain is very common (especially in Everett), as is morning rain that fades to afternoon sunshine and then returns in the evening.
   Metahumanity contributes some of the cloudiness of the area. Air sometimes has trouble moving past those mountains to the east, and all those trash fires in the Barrens, along with industry all across the sprawl, has a cumulative effect. Fog is a frequent morning-and-evening visitor, and often it has odors making it clear it is not simply water vapor floating around. It's great for giving cover to covert nighttime operations, but not so good for more basic purposes like breathing. Tacoma is the part of the sprawl most notable for its range of unpleasant odors, but bad smells can be found anywhere in the sprawl.
   The good news about the climate is temperature extremes are rare. You don't see too many summer days above the mid-thirties, and most winter days get at least a few degrees above the freezing line, if not all the way to ten. That means that the sizable portion of the population without reliable heat and cooling (or luxuries such as a roof) can usually find a way to survive without the elements killing them.
   While Seattle is not immune to the general rule that wealth flows toward waterfronts, it's not a perfectly reliable rule because Seattle has so much shoreline. The Sound runs on almost the entire western border of the sprawl, and while this includes the luxuries of Downtown, it also includes less-glamorous locales like Tacoma and Everett. The well-to-do residents of Bellevue have Lake Washington on which to build palatial estates, but just east of that is Lake Sammamish, where residents of the Redmond Barrens dump trash, shopping carts, and corpses. Water is used many ways across the city- Lake Youngs in Renton is tree-lined and welcoming to strolling residents, while the artificial reservoir known as Lake Tapps in Auburn provides hydroelectric power, a source of cooling for local industries, and a place to dump chemicals. One of those bodies of water is a lot more pleasant to be around than the other.

> Don't be fooled into thinking Lake Tapps is a good spot to dump a body.Yeah, it's toxic, but also a preservative. Bodies
don't dissolve; they more mummify, or embalm. If those are verbs. Anyway, they don't go away.

   Another part of the appeal of Seattle is that its greenery and temperate weather can lull you into

a sense of safety, a feeling that while bad things may happen, true disaster is distant. Hurricanes don't hit it, tornadoes are rare, it's usually too damp for wildfires, and volcanoes are generally too far away to directly harm the city, especially if there's no Great Ghost Dance going on. Earthquakes are a real threat, but big ones manage to occur so infrequently that they don't weigh on people's minds. People may die, the feeling goes, but the city will live.
   One of the curses of being a shadowrunner is you see enough under the fabric of society to know the lie behind that sentiment. The Matrix Crashes were excellent examples of how a seemingly stable infrastructure can rip apart at the seams and throw everything into chaos, and the Matrix is not the only part of daily life that could break. Shutting down the ports, taking out bridges over the Snohomish River, keeping planes from landing at SeaTac-any one of those things would be painful. All of them at once might be ruinous. Get control of the minds of some financial leaders, have them make a few nightmarishly bad decisions, and the bottom falls out of the city's business infrastructure. Complete disaster and ruin are waiting on the other side of the next shadowrun; sometimes they're waiting on the other side of the street. If you run in Seattle for a long time, you are

balancing on a knife blade for years on end. Doing that without losing a significant amount of blood is an accomplishment indeed.

> This is just one of the reasons why, if people know you ran in Seattle, you'll go up a notch or two in their esteem. Of course, then they'll wonder why you aren't there anymore.
> Traveler Jones

THE CULTURE 
Let's start this with admission that defining a single culture in a city of millions is a fool's errand. There are a thousand micro-cultures in the city, sub-groups of people in neighborhoods butting against each other, or different cultures from floor to floor in a megacorporate complex. So yes, this is written with the knowledge that anyone reading this could pick out dozens of people they know in Seattle who don't really reflect these elements at all. What we're talking about is a tendency, an inclina- tion in a certain direction that flows through the various residents of the city.
   That said, there are certain characteristics of Seattle that it's good to know about if you're going to run there, if only so you don't appear like a complete rookie when Mr. Johnson is sizing you up.

   Change: There used to be a time when certain Seattle residents were resistant to change, talking about how things used to be ten, twenty, fifty years ago, and offering suggestions on how the city could reclaim its past. Some of the older residents were called mossbacks, because they had settled in the area like a large, moist rock.
   That doesn't happen much anymore. The sprawl has a way of beating people's resistance to change right out of them. At the top of the sprawl's social pyramid, you have people who have millions or billions of nuyen at their disposal and a government built to facilitate their desires. If they want to bulldoze a neighborhood to make way for a new arcology, they'll bulldoze that neighborhood. If they want to buy out a rival's chain just so they can shut down a dozen locations, allowing their spots to dominate the market, they'll do that. Some buildings may stay put, but ownership will change hands, names and signage will alter, and so on.

> This happens more when there is open competition for business, like spots Downtown. In a subdivision solely owned by one corporation, or inside an arcology, things are more permanent, as the ownership corps don't feel they need to do anything to win the business of the people inside, and they don't really care about impressing them.
> Sunshine
   Meanwhile, at the bottom of the social structure, the Barrens in general may look like a bombed-out war zone day-in, day-out, but the particular details of its devastation change from week to week, or even day to day. Street peddlers migrate from place to place looking for business while avoiding former customers they might have inadvertently poisoned, people squatting in shipping containers move to a new block because someone meaner and tougher than them decided the container should be theirs, and gang territory shifts due to the changing fortunes of the various groups of thugs strewn across the area. In both Redmond and Puyallup, the term "permanent address" is laughable, and you usually have to track down residents of the area the way a lion tracks a wildebeest.
Some things seem permanent-Dante's Inferno, the
Pike Street Market-but Seattleites have learned to treat them like the exception, not the rule.
   Openness: If we remember that there is no such thing as a perfect utopia where everyone is accepted for their skills and character rather than their appearance, then we'll see that Seattle, despite its imperfections, tends to be very accepting of a wide variety of people. Now, I can hear orks and trolls chortling as they read that, and I can hear the protests from people saying it's tough to claim you're accepting when a pretty dedicated

racist has been at the head of the government for years on end, but remember it's a sliding scale. Did it take the Ork Underground a long time to get recognition, leaving tens of thousands of people disenfranchised in the interim? Yeah. But it happened, in a democratic way that would never happen in most of the other cities in the world. So you'll find Humanis and other racists in Seattle, and you'll find every kind of prejudice metahumanity can imagine, but you'll also see orks and elves on the same runner team, trolls and humans in the same bar or the same gang, and humans and dwarfs manning the same roadside work crews. And you won't be surprised to see any of it, and they won't act like it's a big deal. Seattleites are often willing to see what you've got instead of judging you.
   Now, there's a downside (or upside, depending on your perspective) to this. The "live and let live" attitude often leads to people not wanting to rush to judgment about others, so when they see something that appears suspicious or even outright criminal, they may tell themselves that they don't know just what's going on and don't have all the facts, and it's probably none of their business anyway, so they'll just go about their business. This is a problem if someone is beating on you in the street and you'd like someone to jump in and stop it, but it can be beneficial if you're the one committing the crime.

> Note that this primarily applies to the average person on the street, not to law enforcement or security guards. It's not a
good idea to count on them being lax just because of the culture of the city.
> Ma'Fan
   The Seattle Freeze: This sometimes seems like a contrast to the openness quality, but a certain chill toward outsiders sits side by side with an acceptance of those same outsiders. That is to say, just because Seattle residents won't necessarily judge you on your appearance doesn't mean that you'll instantly be friends. You're not just going to stroll into a bar, start up a conversation with strangers, and immediately find yourself part of their runner team. Social networks are important. Getting an introduction from someone who knows someone can help thaw out the freeze, so use them. Remember, just because Seattleites are not always immediately friendly doesn't mean they're mean.

> Don't press your luck, though. I'm not going to introduce
you to all my friends in Seattle just because you ask. You have to earn it.
> Sunshine
> There's some of that warmth to outsiders, right there!
> Ma'Fan

   Loyalty: Loyalty is a quality in short supply in the Sixth World, but there is perhaps a bit more of it in Seattle than you'll find elsewhere. I'm not talking about the megacorps here-they have draconian contract terms and lifelong servitude agreements whose sole purpose is to keep them from having to worry about whether their employees will ever leave them. But if we move beyond the corp drone world, we find people who are somewhat more likely to stick with something they are building rather than jump ship. Runner teams won't disband just because a job goes pear-shaped, street gangs will hang together through lean times, and Mr. Johnson is often more interested in finding a team he can trust than in screwing them over. That loyalty tends to be more to an individual's clique than to the over-arching city organizations, which means Knight Errant has a devil of a time finding people to inform on others or act as confidential informants. The police focus a whole lot more on gathering physical evidence than attempting to find witness testimony, since witnesses are often difficult to come by. They are more loyal to their own people and neighborhood than to the law.
   Remember that this has limits. The loyalty of Seattleites doesn't mean Mr. Johnson will never turn on you, or your teammates will never sell you out for a nice pile of nuyen. This is the Sixth World, after all, and those are the sort of things that happen in the shadows. And if they happen in the shadows, they happen a lot in Seattle. That's the city, in broad strokes. But what the city really is, is the districts, thirteen divisions that in many ways act like separate city-states, each with its own
culture and a mayor. Here's a briefing on all of them.

DOWNTOWN 
Downtown is the heart of the sprawl. When people think of Seattle, they think of Downtown's skyline in its chrome-polished, neon-infused, never sleeps, AR-en- hanced glory.
   Downtown is where the biggest biz in the Sprawl happens. Other districts have their own action, but it pales in comparison to what's happening Downtown. Only the best can handle operating here, and if you can't deal with that fact, then get the hell out.
   What makes Downtown so fragging special? Well, it's got more corporate, business, and government real estate per square kilometer than anywhere else in the Sprawl. Five of the Big Ten megacorps have regional HQs in Downtown, which makes the area ripe for running opportunities.

> And let's not forget all the overlapping security zones. Each corp or government agency defends its own patch of turf in

different ways. The government is usually legally bound not to kill you outright for stepping on their lawn. But with the corps' extraterritoriality, it's a totally different story.
> Slamm-0!
   But all work and no play makes Downtown a dull boy. So when biz is done, Downtown is the place to go. Want to check out the trendiest shops? Need to find that hard-to-find item? Want to dance the night away in the hottest nightlife scene in the Pac-Northwest? Care to sample some of the finest in local or exotic cuisine? Are you a professional sports fan? Or maybe you're a touristy type who likes local flavor. Then guess what, omae? Downtown is for you!

> More shadowruns happen in Downtown than any other district. It's also the best area, IMHO, for mixing business
with pleasure.
> Kat o' NineTales


BELLEVUE 
If Downtown is where the rich and powerful go to work and party, then Bellevue is where they sleep at night, tucked away in tailored micro-arcologies and shuffied around the city in luxury APCs. "The Belle" got its nick- name from longtime mayor Marilyn Shultz, who dubbed it "belle of the ball" and the most popular place to live in Seattle. A version of that name dug itself into the psyche of the residents.
   The slogan, like Bellevue itself, is a complete fabrication. Nothing is genuine. Bellevue is based on every image we see on the trid of an idealized suburban enclave culture; a Horizon-scrubbed vision of the best stuff to emerge out of other parts of the city.
   This false vision extends into the racial makeup of the area. Twenty years ago the ork population was close to twenty percent, but a long campaign of redlining and Tolkien-esque bigotry redistributed the population breakdown. Recent years took things one step further, triggering an influx of highly educated corporate types with disposable incomes looking to live in the next "it" part of the city.
   The Belle is that place. Bellevue boasts rolling green hills, lakes, and million-dollar views of Downtown. The area is speckled with gated communities that are arcologies in everything but name. Several offer domes and purified air shipped in from the Canadian wilds. This style of living comes with a high price tag, and even



THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE

145




if you have the money you also need to have the social capital to jump to the front of the waiting list.
   Still, not everyone in Bellevue is white-collar wealthy. Virtually all of the population is corporate affiliated; yet sixteen percent of the people still live below the poverty level, most of whom are not affiliated with the corps. These are the workers who keep Bellevue running while living in a society entirely separate from their upper- echelon counterparts. The two sides rarely meet, but when they do it is usually back-alley affairs, black- market deals, or rich kids trying to play gutterpunk.


TACOMA 
Tacoma will forever be etched in memory as the place where the Night of Rage found its worst moments and some of its greatest heroes. When the violence peaked, the Sheraton Tacoma opened its doors to fleeing meta- humans and protected them through the night. Once the tide shifted from rage to remembrance, sculptors erect- ed a Crying Wall to commemorate the sacrifice. That wall became a symbol and eventually a tourist attraction that brought more attention to the area.

> So by "attention," you mean "unwanted metahuman attention." I suppose that's the reason Tacoma went to hell?
> Khan-a-Saur
   Tacoma was an area on the rise-an area originally built around the very particular needs of Shiawase- but in recent times the tide quite literally shifted. The Nicaragua Canal diverted shipping from the area, and with it the shoreline commerce that powered the city's wealth dropped. Office Parks emptied. Tacoma fell victim to sagging real-estate prices and thriller gangs. The so- called City of Tomorrow faded into yesterday's news.


EVERETT 
Not yet a barrens, not even definitively slated to become one, Everett is balanced on a teetering scale, waiting for

one thing or another to shift the district into whatever it will become. There are high-tech corp facilities here, res- idences most of us can only dream about obtaining, but also areas of high abandonment, squatters' paradises, and traffic routes where smugglers outnumber law-abiding folks. The population of the district is growing, but it's un- clear if this is people moving here as a staging ground for a better life or people falling to this district from something better. One large investment in a mixed-use complex may push the district into a long, upward growth trend; while a riot, other disturbance, or simply a persistent increase in violent crime may doom it to becoming the cousin of Red- mond and Puyallup. My crystal ball isn't telling me how it will end up, but I can tell you this: Many people across the sprawl are plotting on ways to profit from whatever chang- es overtake Everett. But that's not exactly news.
   The good news is that people like us don't need to wait for the district's fate to be decided to enjoy it. Have you ever been in Bellevue on a run and wished you could just travel a few blocks and lose yourself in the twisted ruins of Redmond's streets? Well, while Everett's highs do not approach Bellevue and their lows do not touch Redmond, you still have a chance to lift something from a corporate pad, travel a short distance, then hide out in an abandoned apartment complex full of squatters. Enjoy it while you can.

> If I had to wager, I'd say the area is as low as it's going to
get and will soon trace an upward, gentrifying pathway. Federated-Boeing has invested substantially in the area and is unlikely to sit on the sidelines while Everett becomes a barrens around it. They may have to wait until after the election, once Brackhaven or his successor has their feet under them, but I'd expect some major Everett redevelopment to be on the agenda for early 2079.
> Mr. Bonds


RENTON
Considered by many to be "Seattle's Apartment," Renton was once one an example of Sixth World suburbia run amok. Compared to other districts such as Downtown, Tacoma, or even Redmond and the Ork Underground, Renton is almost forgettable. Simply put, Renton is the place that nice wageslaves and other working-class drones looked to as an example of "making it."
   Renton isn't where business is done, it's the place that the nice, "good" people of Seattle call home and


146	THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE




retire to when the working day is done. It's where families live and (try to) play in a nice wholesome, neo- WASPy, family-values state of domestic bliss. Or at least, that's the sales pitch.

> In other words, it's the kind of place that makes most runners (or anyone with the capability for independent thought) want to puke. Renton is so damn artificial and bland that it hurts!
> Slamm-0!
   For decades, Renton was the home of several security services and small tech firms; the latter were hit hard after Crash 2.0, while the former got even bigger. In the following years, the local economy foundered and crime rose. In the past two years, however, the new Matrix has helped reinvigorate Renton's tech industry, and the district has been slowly returning to its former perceived glory.
   Renton has an abundance of nice housing along with enough shopping and entertainment to keep residents satisfied. Throw in some green hills, lakes, and rivers for good measure, and it's little wonder why so many people want to live here. Too bad it has an undercurrent of anti- metahuman racism just below that wonderful middle-class façade, along with a few nasty local criminal elements.
   Ever since the Night of Rage, Renton has been a Humanis stronghold, even though no one will admit it. Because of a combination of (slightly) shifting societal norms and increasing metahuman birth rates (especially among orks), hardliner racists and bigots in Renton have been forced to impotently watch as "metahuman encroachment" threatened their idea of domestic tranquility. But that just means they switched tactics.

> As much as I still hate Renton, I have to be honest for the sake of accuracy. Things aren't as bad as they used to be even a decade ago. Metahumans can walk the streets of Renton without too much fear of being assaulted on sight, because anti-metahumanism is seriously frowned upon-at least openly. Metahumans who live in Renton can expect more subtle attacks against them, however. Poor service at some shops/eateries/public services, being stopped in the street for no reason other than just being an ork, receiving less leniency by KE patrols, or just being silently shunned by the locals are just some of the public things metahuman residents of Renton can expect. Behind closed doors, it's worse.
> Bull




AUBURN 
The first thing people talk about when they get close to Auburn is the hum. The sound, like the famous Taos hum, seems to come from everywhere at once; a low-frequen- cy buzz that can only be the result of 363 square kilome- ters of industrial equipment churning twenty-four hours a day. The people who live here put up with it, because that is who they are-survivors. They are the blue-collar wageslaves who keep the gears of Seattle spinning. This mentality results in a community that is extremely in- sular, preferring to take care of its own problems. Those problems are plentiful, including a budding race war and a Mafia family trying desperately to hold on to its claim.
   On the bright side, real-estate prices here are excellent, which is why a handful of tech start-ups chose to make Auburn the new Silicon Valley. New capital and new attitudes have not gone well with the locals, leading to a cultural separation that mirrors the age-old separation of haves and have-nots.

> With all of the automated manufacturing, Auburn is the
easiest place to acquire cheap gear and services, but the community isn't big on outsiders. You need to know someone in order to get anywhere in Auburn, so get real good at making friends and keeping them.
> Pistons


SNOHOMISH 
When most folks think of Seattle, they think of the hus- tle and bustle of the Emerald City, so the quiet coun- try of Snohomish comes as quite a disquieting surprise. It's an old-fashioned community that managed to hold together when most of the changes occurred in Seattle after the Great Ghost Dance. Before and after that event, it has been the main source of locally grown produce for all of Seattle. Many have called it the Breadbasket of the Emerald City for its expansive wheat fields, but I don't want that to be the only image people have. Snohomish has wheat, corn, and soy fields in abundance, but it also has hundreds of apple orchards, berry farms of every va- riety, potato farms that rival the Idaho of old, and large greenhouses that grow everything from peaches to cof- fee, both out of season and out of their normal region.
   Along with all this food production, the rest of what you would expect from agribusinesses came along for the ride. Underground growth testing sites; river pens full of



THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE

modified salmon and seaweed; and massive soy processing plants to turn those bland little beans into delicious dishes and pastes. The megacorps have research and development work going on all over this region to develop better crops. And by "better" I mean producing more money for them, not healthier or anything crazy like that.
   Beyond farms and fish, Snohomish is well-known for its antiques and has been for over a hundred years. The difference is, a hundred years ago the odds of an antique possessing accessible arcane potential were non- existent. Now, those looking for those rare items that have been infused with mana from powerful emotional events or pre-Awakening ritual magic often find them here. During the recent rush to find arcane artifacts, Snohomish became a popular location for folks to trade and make their deals, since it already had a reputation for arcane antiquities. Several individuals in this area have made names for themselves in the field of artifact identification and classification, making it a popular spot for artifacts to pass through or spend some time while these folks dig up their mysteries.

> What a pleasant view! Too bad that's not even close to
the most shadowy aspect of Snohomish. While food and antiques may be big business, and thus important to runners, it's the corporate safehouses that bring most runners to this quiet district. The run-down farms, abandoned homes, and a few small mountain cabins on the outskirts are used by companies, governments, and shadowy organizations to lie low or stash important assets while the heat dies down.
> Traveler Jones
> The rare and lucky runner might get some training time at one of the several corporate black-ops training sites in
Snohomish as well. Several corps that have safehouses here also have training grounds.The trainees are sometimes used as first responders (or only responders when they want it kept quiet). The sites are usually located on former farms where the ground can't sustain crops anymore.
> Hard Exit
> Can't finish this part up without mentioning that Snohomish
is the most racist district in the 'plex. It's a regular spot for Humanis recruitment, and they're rumored to have a training facility for members of the militant arm of the Human Nation, the Flaming Sword. Metahumans are regularly assaulted, and murder investigations tend to be short and usually blamed on other metahumans.

FORT LEWIS 
Do you know what Fort Lewis is? Fort Lewis is your chance to look at a totally different dystopia than the one we have. Sick and tired of living in a corporate-con- trolled dystopia? Then head on down to Fort Lewis for a chance to look at an authoritarian military dystopia! Vive la difference!
   One advantage of the military dystopia? It's clean- er. The military puts up with far less crap than Knight Errant cops tolerate, and soldiers in general are pretty good at keeping the place neat and not throwing garbage around.

> Cleanliness and order have always been some of the
hallmarks of an authoritarian regime. It's part of their appeal-whatever their faults, they can at least keep things orderly.
> Goat Foot
   It also is a lot prettier than most parts of Seattle, with its lush greenery and relative quiet. Honestly, it's downright eerie-go there some morning, when the fog is brushing the pines, and listed to the muffied quiet. A bird will chirp here and there, and then fly away as another sound slowly rises. You'll hear it before you see it, the sound of boots hitting the ground in unison as some patrol or another passes nearby. Freaks me out ev- ery time. And it's even worse in the evening, when they play "Taps."

> Man, do you ever have some weird problem with the army. It's pretty clear you never served.
> Hard Exit
   Now, don't let me give you the wrong impression. Fort Lewis has a seedy side-it just does a lot better job than other places of keeping the criminality and debauchery behind closed doors. The place is populated with people, after all, and people are going to pursue their vices. It's what we do. The leaders of Fort Lewis would just rather such activities be kept in their proper place, out of the sight of children and the faint of heart.
   And then, because nothing in the Sixth World is com- plete without a touch of the surreal, in the middle of this military state in miniature is one of the most popular family destinations in the sprawl, the Fort Lewis Zoolog- ical Gardens, with some of the most spectacular critters to be held in captivity on display in stunning replicas of their natural habitats. Of course, behind the scenes of the zoo, researchers are looking into how to tap into, alter, or even enhance the powers of the critters kept there, which means the friendliest part of Fort Lewis is also the one with perhaps the best odds of killing us all.

> Some of that depends on how much the military decides to
share with others. Any general knows the value of having technology that the other side lacks, so any breakthroughs in critter-related research, especially when it comes to critter- based security, are likely to be kept under wraps instead of disseminated far and wide.

something so powerful that they'll lose control, break out, and start killing us in our sleep.

REDMOND 
If you've never lived in Redmond, you don't know Red- mond. Wageslaves on day trips or rich thrill-seekers on weekend benders can never know what it's like here. Neither can runners who happen to have a safehouse here just to lie low for a while. Yeah, they see the same drek. They smell the same filth. The difference is, they

get to leave. For those of us who were born into it and don't know anything else, it's not that easy to escape.
   But sooner or later, every shadowrunner finds themselves in Redmond, where Seattle dreams come to die. Nothing thrives here. It's infertile. Unproductive. Toxic. That's why they call 'em Barrens. Once upon a time, Redmond was shiny. It was Seattle's new tech district, full of innovators and their money. But now, Redmond is like a perverse dreamcatcher, capturing and distilling the nightmares of the entire Seattle sprawl. After the tech crash of '29, Redmond lost everything. Eighty percent of its industry tanked overnight, along with its government. Everyone with means bolted. With no authorities to stop them, those who were left behind turned to rioting, looting, and every other form of lawlessness. Metahuman nature, chummers. The abandoned businesses and homes were irresistible to the addicted, destitute, and criminal from all over the sprawl, so while the rest of Seattle was getting cleaned up, Redmond was collecting society's detritus.
Even the "safe" areas of Redmond are more socially
diseased than the worst parts of Seattle proper. Redmond is broken up into fiefdoms, separated by wastelands of decaying technology. Tribes of gangs, acting like warlords, each control their own slice of hell. What used to be high-density areas became the most sought-after



THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE

real estate. The corp buildings and assets that remain are fortified with strong walls and heavy artillery. Most of the time, mercs or local gangers play security. Utilities like water, trash, sewage, and electricity don't function; anyone with those luxuries has jury-rigged their place to get them.

> The Matrix used to be nearly impossible to access in Redmond, but the new Matrix infrastructure has improved
things a bit. Describing it as "spotty" is still generous, though.
> Slamm-0!
> You said it. The astral in the Barrens is fragged up pretty bad, too. Unless you have been raised there, slinging spells feels
like swimming in jelly.
> Lyran
   Astonishingly, Redmond has a government. Sonya Scholl is the mayor of Redmond. She's usually fighting with the corps here, but she's managed to choose her battles wisely. And she's won some (it helps that the corps don't care enough about Redmond to put their full heart into the fight). Unfortunately, no amount of winning can make any real difference here.

> Sounds downbeat, but it's accurate. If the Barrens gets anything-a new business that's making money, a runner
who made a big score-the first thought is to get out. In Redmond, success is defined by leaving.
> Haze
> Nothing gold can stay.
> Man-of-Many-Names
   Hope is the rarest thing in Redmond, and that's good, because hope gets you killed. Makes you think about tomorrow. Distracts you from surviving right now. And that's all that's left in the Barrens-survival.


PUYALLUP 
"Barrens," they say, lumping us all together. Redmond, too, like we're next-door neighbors, not sixty kilometers apart. Here in Puyallup, we're used to getting written off by outsiders. They figure we're just ashy gutters, Mafiosi and Yakuza thugs tearing each other apart, beetle dens and whorehouses competing for desperate nuyen, elves and orks killing each other over table scraps and corner deals.
   We are all those things, but those things ain't all we are. People friggin' live here, chummer. Always have, and always will. A hundred years ago this was farmland,

wide-open spaces, blue skies, and green hills. Then came Rainier and refugees, ash and assholes, the Night of Rage and Tír Tairngire's leftovers. After that, we layered on a couple generations of corrupt politicians and parasitic crime families sucking the place dry. Sprinkle with desperation. Add a pinch of hatred. Season to taste.
   So we ain't like Downtown, sure, but people are still just people. Over half a million souls-just by official count-are trying to get by, wanting to live their life, put a roof overhead, fill their belly, have some kids.
   If the corps would give us half a chance, just a fair shake, they could make some real money here. We've got space. We've got nothing but room for improvement, we've got people with nothing but hunger for a better tomorrow. They could build here, instead of always being teases about it. They could invest, and we could work, buy, sell. Everyone would win.
   But that ain't what Puyallup's for, if you ask our neighbors. Nope. They come here to hide from the law, to buy drugs or chips, to rent joyboys or cred-slots, to bash some keeblers. They come here in tricked-out racers to compete, or souped-up rigs about to make the Route 7 smuggling run. They come here to slum it, to get a kick out of some real streets if Bellevue or Downtown are too safe for their liking.
   Someone once said you don't pay a hooker for the sex, you pay 'em to leave you alone afterwards. To our neighbors, Puyallup's that working girl. They come here so they can leave again, and feel better about themselves for doing so.


COUNCIL ISLAND 
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Council Island was known as Mercer Island, named for brothers Asa and Thomas Mercer who were the first white men to call it home. It grew into a thriving community, joining Seattle in 1960. With the signing of the First Treaty of Denver, the greater Seattle metroplex was retained as American territory, serving as the largest non-native reservation in North America, while Mercer Island was ceded to the Sal- ish-Shidhe Council to serve as an ambassadorial residence and a general touchstone with other native nations. The Salish razed the modern buildings and stripped the road- ways, spending over a decade restoring the land to a natu- ral state while embedding power, water, and Matrix nodes well out of sight. Under the leadership of first Chief Jon Moses, then Chief James Grey Bear, the Salish ambassa- dor to Seattle for decades, Council Island was turned into


150	THE SECRETS OF SEATTLE




one of the prettiest areas of Seattle while also serving in a diplomatic capacity. The death of Grey Bear just before the negotiations for the third Treaty of Denver was dev- astating, as his seasoned experience as a negotiator was missed and talks eventually collapsed. As Denver has re- treated, Council Island has stepped up, and now stands as the primary ambassadorial region for the NAN. The island is still adapting to this new status, and new buildings are springing up rapidly.

> Council Island's groaning under the weight of the Salish- Shidhe Battalion that was assigned there in the wake of the
collapse of the Third Treaty of Denver negotiations. On top of this they have the expanded NAN-corp presence on the island, but it's the soldiers who have really done a number on the demographics, particularly in terms of bringing down the average of pay and education. Three quarters of the troopers are orks, with more than five hundred being drawn from the Cascade Ork tribe, where you can enlist as young as sixteen and without a high school diploma. With soldiers come higher levels of carousing and prostitution.
> SeaTac Sweetie
> The SS-Council has never been clear about that "other" population of about a hundred and fifty sentients. Do they
count spirits in this number or not? Artificial intelligences? We know that there are shapeshifters and wendigo in the mix, but what else? Rumors are that there are intelligent fresh-water merrow present, or even a draco-forms. The only ones who know for certain are the Salish-Shidhe, and they aren't telling.
> Elijah
   Council Island is left in a natural state-or more accu- rately is guided into a natural-seeming state-as much as possible. Greenery is ever-present, most obviously in tree coverage and shrubbery, but in the spring and summer months, there's a colorful explosion from the widespread flowers in bloom. Buildings are constructed to resemble the traditional dwellings of the Pacific Northwest Natives but are made of modern materials with a thin wooden veneer, rather than being actual wooden structures. It should be reminded that, all across the island, this theme will be seen repeatedly; citizens in native garb who're us- ing cutting-edge NeoNET commlinks, wireless support is drawn from unseen points hidden in artwork or foun- tains, and while you'll never see a hint of modern wiring strung through trees, the roots share the ground with an impressive array of circuitry and pipes. The NAN are quite proud of their technical adaptability but always give a nod to tradition, and if you think of them as primitive due to their wearing of facepaint and feathers, the failure's on you, not them. The majority of the population is com- posed of bureaucrats, diplomats, and their families, but there are quite a few scientists around as well, including botanists and parabiologists.
> 
We Seattleites can forget this often, thanks to the NAN tourism
boards always pushing for "NearCations" in Salish territory, and we all know somebody who was broken by the rat race, sold everything they owned, and joined an ersatz "tribe" to get back to nature. The vast majority of NAN citizens live in cities (former American cities at that!), drive cars, grumble about taxes, and check the news on their commlink, all before getting ready for today's meeting about the Running Deer account. There's a bit more environmentalism and the spiritual beliefs are different, but otherwise, they function in the city and share the same concerns, with same range of beliefs, as everyone else.
> Bull
> There are also those who fully walk the Old Path, but it is a choice that must be made, not an obligation to force upon
another. It is a harder path, one fraught with danger, but what you see while walking it is glorious.
> Man-of-Many-Names
> While NAN drones and choppers can fly around, Council Island is officially NAN airspace and they are quite antsy
about defending that airspace. If you aren't in a medivac chopper or on a pre-cleared diplomatic visit, expect spirits to land you gently in the lake.

THE UNDERGROUND 
The Ork Underground has roots dating back to Seattle's ancient history. After the Great Seattle Fire of 1889, they decreed that new buildings must be made of fire-resistant material rather than wood. Since the city was built on a floodplain, which often, you know, flooded, they decided to lift everything by two stories as well. The lower levels of older buildings were used mostly for storage, and eventu- ally they were just sealed off and ignored. In the late twen- tieth century, there was some interest in exploring them again, revealing that in the years between the undercity had been expanded by bootleggers and red-light workers, then expanded again by the city for underground transit. Some areas were refurbished and cleaned up for tourism, while most were left untouched.

son gas pockets (poison is far more dangerous than lava in an eruption, but lava gets all the airtime). Desperate peo- ple gradually opened small pathways down below, first the homeless, then the goblinized, as society turned a blind eye. "Out of sight, out of mind," after all. In 2039, Gover- nor Victor Allenson rounded up every metahuman in Se- attle and concentrated them into camps in the warehouse districts of Tacoma and downtown. On February 7, those warehouses all went up in flame. Thankfully, the goblins down below had already opened some passages for smug- gling supplies up; those passages were then used to get thousands of people to safety. Not everyone, but a great many. If you ever wonder who's getting burned in effigy during the Night of Rage remembrances, it's Allenson.

> Rotting in Hell's too good for him.
> Butch
   The city woke up from the madness and most of the metahumans were brought back into society, but many couldn't overcome the betrayal. They stayed below. Gob- lins and dwarfs worked together to expand the under- ground tunnels, shore them up, and establish places both large enough for a community to thrive and small enough to provide hiding places should they ever be needed again. They further discovered many tunnels created in the after- math of the volcanic eruptions; science can't explain how they came to be, but to the creators of the underground, they were a blessing no matter the source.

we're certain about the source.

   In the mid '40s, there was a big falling out between the ork and dwarf communities. There'd been many arguments in the past, but the trolls had always managed to keep the peace, but this time? It was too much. The dwarfs, who'd had the majority of engineering lore and college education, gathered up for a mass exodus, turning the Seattle Under- ground into the Ork Underground. Details are sketchy about what caused it, but the dwarfs have carried a grudge about it ever since.
Which brings us to today. The Seattle Underground, re-

branded now that it's official, is the hottest property in the 'plex. Young artists and risk-taking investors are flocking to the area, marveling at the low cost of living and thriving local culture. Gentrification is a growing concern, but with it comes a massive overhaul of city services, with legiti- mate power and water lines instead of spotty, and illegal, taps. There was also work to improve schools, and Renraku will soon break ground on the first hospital in the Under- ground's history. Sanitation, police protection, and badly needed nuyen are flooding in.

> And orks are flooding out.
> OrkCEO
> When Prop 23 passed, making the Ork Underground an official city region, the dwarfs who'd left thirty years ago
started streaming back, bringing with them documentation about ownership, hiring Hard Corps to toss hundreds of orks out of their homes. Women, children, families-it didn't matter. Gimli Harris (third-oldest dwarf in Seattle-there are lots of first-generation names like that) is the angry face of the "Reclaimers," driving a wedge through the heart of the Underground. They claim original ownership of great swaths of land, using strong-arm tactics to drive out the locals and establish settlements along prime territory. They claim it's about heritage. The orks claim it's hate.
> Sunshine
> Despite what you'll see in corporate media, most orks down there are ordinary people, working two or three jobs, trying
to raise money to raise a family in peace. They're as worried about gang activity and crime as anyone else, but the dwarf incursion is agitating extremists to activity.
> Butch
> Of course, these counterattacks are recorded and rebroadcast by the media, who are all too happy to paint orks as violent
brutes and savages. It keeps escalating and won't end well.
> 2XL
> The Underground's always been poor. Who's paying for this massive level of reconstruction? Renraku has to be taking a
huge loss on this one.
> Riot
> Nope! Now that the city's made it official, Renraku's being paid while the city runs up the debt. Brackhaven'll be handing
a giant pot of crap to any successor, and the budget crisis is being placed on the "uppity orks" rather than the corporation that's "just doing what it was hired to do." Telling you, those guys are artists.

This chapter contains thirty Contract Briefs, plotlines for games you can play. With the information in these briefs and the characters in the Street People chapter, you can quickly get a game going. Since there are some plot twists and other such info, we'll provide the follow- ing disclaimer:

   IT'S PROBABLY BEST IF ONLY GAMEMASTERS READ THIS CHAPTER.
   Sorry, players. We love you, and we hope the rest of the book offers lots of fun for you, but the fun might be maximized if you keep yourself from knowing some of the material in this chapter.
   So, gamemasters, now that we're down to just you, let's talk about what's here. The plot structures of the Contract Briefs are generally loose, often leaving room for the players to add their own twists and develop- ments. Sometimes this means the ending is not set in stone; other times there are secrets that the gamemaster may eventually reveal, though the way the secrets come out may or may not follow the exact pattern outlined in the adventure.
   The point is, the Contract Briefs are structures play- ers and gamemasters can use to build games and plots from, but they should not be viewed as iron-clad gospel.

They are tools to get the story moving and to provide interesting story twists, but not strict outlines you must follow in order to avoid playing the game wrong.
   Most of the Briefs in this chapter are a single page, and likely would take a single gaming session to cover (though given the creativity of shadowrunners, some of them may well go for multiple sessions). Toward the end of the chapter are Briefs with multiple parts to them, so that they form longer campaigns. Beyond these Briefs, some free-standing Briefs can be linked together to cre- ate campaigns as well. For example, the Bear spirit totem of Onto the Path (p. 158) might introduce the players to the fire spirit of The Light Within (p. 166), who, after that contract is over, might decide he wants the Fairy Flag to help him in his work with his cult, which leads players to Let Your Flag Fly (p. 160). The point is, wheth- er you want standalone missions or longer campaigns, the tools are here to make them!
   Note that each Mr. Johnson's Pitch contains the Karma payment offered by Mr. Johnson, stated as an amount of karma each player would receive. Players can always attempt a negotiation, and the payment can be adjusted by the gamemaster based on extenuating circumstanc- es (like maybe they're doing a job because they owe Mr. Johnson a favor from a previous job, and thus they should be taking less pay). Generally speaking, though, payment should not dip lower than 3 Karma, and should not be negotiated to higher than 9.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The runners are hired by Jody Stubblefield, a high-level data analyst at Hildebrandt-Kleinfort-Bernal, one of the largest banks in the world. He's made a discovery that has placed his life in great danger. Strange things have been happening to him lately. He says he is being followed, that someone's been going through his garbage, and his family is getting strange calls. Jody needs to get to a safe location and be kept from harm until he can sell what he has. If he is kept safe, the PCs receive 4 Karma, with a 2 Karma bonus for keeping Stubblefield's data safe.

OBJECTIVES 
> Help Stubblefield retrieve data from his apartment
> Get Stubblefield to a safehouse
> Repel gang attack



THE SETTING 
The job starts in a pretty typical slice of Renton. The low- rent neighborhood all around is poor and a bit dangerous, but not controlled by the local gangs ... yet. The Stuffer Shack down the block is the only source of food for a few kilometers, but even that monument to greed-by-way- of-junk-food looks pretty battered and neglected.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Elite soldiers, Enemy Drones (Small)
   Jody tells the runners that before they head to a safe- house, he needs to grab something from his apartment. He left a copy of his research data there and needs to destroy it so no one else can get to it first. Jody is para- noid, but the runners see no evidence of anyone out to get him.
   After looking around for a bit, Jody becomes errat- ic. He can't find the other copy. As Jody continues to franticly look around for the data, a dwarf strike team ambushes the runners inside the house. These are not typical corporate security or even military. The dwarfs

seem to be an elite-ops group, although the only distin- guishing feature is a small, almost unnoticeable (have the runners make a Perception test of Very Hard difficul- ty) patch on their sleeves which reads: "Zhigul M."

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: None
   Jody's data is found after the fight, possibly on the body of one of the dwarf strike team members. Jody begs the runners to get him to the security of the safe- house, and on the way, he begins to ramble. Jody in- sists that while analyzing and archiving physical bank information from before the Matrix Crash of 2029, he came across a pattern of deposits and withdrawals that seemed curious.
   Stubblefield claims to have found similar bank dis- crepancies from all over the globe, but much of the data had been tampered with. When he analyzed the net ef- fect these discrepancies had on the global economy, it seemed twenty billion nuyen could not be accounted for. Digging deeper, he found the companies that were re- sponsible for the discrepancies no longer exist, and the people supposedly serving as officers and board mem- bers can't be found on any records after 2029.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   While there may be digressions along the way, eventu- ally the runners should get Jody to a safehouse. Once there, Jody's commlink rings and he shouts that he has a buyer for his data. Outside, a local gang has descended upon the safehouse. The gangers aren't tough, but there are a lot of them. This can be a bruising combat because of the sheer number of gangers, but at some point Jody interrupts it by yelling out that he has the money. The gangers' leader glances at a freshly received message and then orders a retreat. The gangers disperse and run back to their hovels.
   Jody pays the runners and mentions that he has more work for them if they want it.

EPILOGUE
   As the story unfolds, the players and GM might have developed some of the secrets about where the money went and who received it. Stubblefield certainly would like to pursue these leads (and perhaps gain a chunk of the missing money), so he can be the nudge the team needs to keep looking for answers. If no answers come up, have some of the money trail leading to shell com- panies around Biloxi, Mississippi, where an impressive new dwarf-owned tech university has recently opened.

 BLACK STAR RISING 
CONTEXT 
Background: Black Star was a group of neo-anarchist shadowrunners. Over time, Black Star became militant and joined Amazonia in a war against Aztlan. The war took a huge toll on the group, and at this point only one member remains alive-a runner named Liberator.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The runners grab their gear and head to an abandoned airstrip. They're met by a winsome female elf and offered a job to board a plane immediately for Bogota, on the border of Aztlan and Amazonia. They'll help Mrs. John- son liberate a weapons cache belonging to old friends of hers. If the runners accept the job, their new employer introduces herself as Rose Red (see p. 116). She offers 5 Karma for the runners' help.

OBJECTIVES 
> Smuggle themselves into Zona Norte in Bogota
> Find the weapons cache
> Receive payment, survive counter terrorist forces



THE SETTING 
Bogotá is a city of extremes. High rises border shanty- towns while colonial churches face theaters, universi- ties and cantinas. Spanish and Aztlaner culture commin- gle with abject poverty and untold wealth surrounded by the stench of destruction and conflict.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Insurgents (use Gangers),
Security Guards (use Rent-a-cops), Enemy Drones (Small)
   The plane lands outside of Bogota. Rose Red tells the runners that their destination is the Zona Norte

section of the city. Aztlan remains vigilant against in- surgent groups, so security is tight. To get in, the run- ners can get smuggled in, acquire fake SINs and talk smooth, use bribery, or figure out whatever their cre- ative minds can develop.
SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Outpost drunks (use Gangers)
   Once inside, Rose Red says a runner named Liber- ator was the last person to see the cache. Whether the runners use violence, persuasion, or bribes, someone in Zona Norte will point them to a bar called the Out- post, saying that Liberator has been known to hang out there. At the bar, the runners can gain information on Liberator's current whereabouts-namely, holed up in a nearby hotel.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: None
   The runners find the small hotel on the outskirts of Zona Norte. No one answers the door to Liberator's room; when the runners enter, they find him bleeding in a corner from multiple stab wounds. Seeing Rose Red, he smiles and relaxes. He tells her he thought he was the last of Black Star. Rose tells him, "there are still plenty of us out there; we just didn't want any part of a war." He smiles and says, "Me neither," and breathes his last. (Don't force this death. If the players try hard to save him, that is okay.)
   After composing herself, Rose Red lifts the carpet to reveal a cellar full of weapons, armor, and intelligence. Satisfied, she pays the runners and says she'll stay with the cache, but the plane should be waiting for them.

FUTURE HOOKS
   If the runners were professional, and not overly vio- lent, Rose will extend an offer to join the renewed Black Star, a group of neo-anarchists-for-hire, with less of a ter- rorist orientation and more of a focus on helping people.

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: Aztlaner Counter-insurgent Soldiers (use Elite Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Medium)
As the runners make their way to the plane, they find
an Aztlan counter-terrorist group was tipped off to their presence. In order to leave Bogota, they will have to fight their way past the soldiers and onto the plane.

 FOOD FIGHT 
THERE'S NO MR. JOHNSON 
Food Fight is meant to be a quick, combat-heavy, whirl- wind that you throw the players into as an introductory adventure (to test out new characters or Anarchy conver- sions), or that you add to an existing Shadowrun, hitting them when their armor is chewed up, they're beat down, and they're least expecting it.

OBJECTIVES 
> Relax for once (just kidding!)
> Role-play and look into what everyone's favorite snacks say about them.
> Survive the robbery, and try not to spill your tasty beverage.


THE SETTING 
Stuffer Shack is a Sixth World classic, a temple to con- sumerism, garbage food being cheaper than anything healthy or fresh, and sugar as the true opiate of the masses. What's not to love?! With a bay of old-style ar- cade machines on one wall, a dizzying array of half-fro- zen drinks to dispense, and a plethora of salty, sweet, and soy products for consumers to kill themselves with, it's a fantastic late-night destination for the hun- gry runner on the go. Whether players go for a Nuke- a-Wave burrito like mom used to make, a Frozee-Treet slurry, or a CHOCO-PUNCH snack, have fun making up and describing a ridiculous assortment of over-pro- cessed garbage food.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
   Suggested NPCS: Use six Gangers with colorful names if you want to keep things simpler and easier. For a tougher fight, modify a few archetypes and jump in: Catcher (gang leader and instigator of the robbery, stats as Wagon, p. 130, minus the medical skills), Slic- er Dicer (a wannabe samurai desperate for a duel, stats as Borderline, p. 88, minus ranged weapons), Wendy (a thrill-ganger psyscho gal and bad influence on Wylie, stats as Kix, p. 102), Static (a big cybered-up burnout, stats as Sledge, p. 82, with only a pistol), Wylie (a teen- aged shaman with a boyish crush on Wendy, stats as Coydog, p. 74), and Spike (the scared rookie, stats as a generic Ganger, who can maybe be talked down).
   Wreck the consumer-idyllic scene with a spray of autofire, and a psycho screaming that this is a robbery. Simple criminals in the late 2070s don't have much cash they can demand (though they'll gladly take any corpo- rate scrip from cowed shoppers), but they're eager to take physical goods (commlinks, jewelry, or even fire- arms) or to try to threaten Stuffer Shack patrons into ini- tiating a nuyen transfer. Catcher and his Chiller Thrillers are in it for the fun of the slaughter; too much partying, too many fried brains, too little conscience to go around. Don't forget to make the fight messy as the shelves of foodstuff absorb any shots fired, or as close combat at- tacks throw people into them. For some inspiration, roll 1D6 to consult the Food Fight chart, then a second 1D6
to get more details in just what kind of mess is made

AFTERMATH 
The owners of this Stuffer Shack will effusively praise the runners for their help, wipe the security cameras if the team wishes to remain anonymous, and will hurry each of them away-before security responds-with a cart full of whatever they want, free of charge. Handling the laundry and bathing needed might require a real fix- er, though!

DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT ARCOLOGY
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Arcology n. Architectural Ecology. Massive building that houses a self-sustaining, densely populat- ed habitat with no need for import or export.

A.C.H.E. n. Arcology Commercial and Housing Enclave. Ninth largest building in the world. Formerly the Renr- aku Arcology.

BACKGROUND
In 2059, a rogue artificial intelligence shut down the ar- cology and subjected those within to nightmarish con- ditions. Seattle stripped the Arcology from Renraku and turned the lower five floors into a shopping mall. Two hundred floors above are sealed off to house Seattle's welfare recipients, often involuntarily. The arcology's highest floors remain a mystery.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
"My employer, Shiawase Corporation, has made a bid to purchase the ACHE. As a show of good faith, they have offered to provide a containment unit around it, to facil- itate renovation without danger to the community. This dome prevents communication in or out, and has a con- tained EMP to shut down any cybernetic threats.
   "My employer wants to take inventory of the arcol- ogy and its systems before work begins. Unfortunately, the UCAS government occupies the underground levels, where the nuclear reactors are located.
   "You will break into the lowest levels, get past the UCAS soldiers, and install a program code onto the nu- clear reactor network. The program will diagnose and re- cord relevant info for twenty-four hours. When finished, collect the data and get out."
   If the runners deliver the data to Mr. Johnson, they are promised payment of 6 Karma.

OBJECTIVES 
> Break into the ACHE. Gain access to basement.
> Install program code onto nuclear reactor network.
> Collect data and escape.

THE SETTING 
The mall's temporarily closed. It's eerily quiet and the runners can't help but feel dread as they head through the giant, empty hallways. A specter of hidden threats and mechanized terror still lingers here. Although noth- ing accosts them, they should feel like something will at any moment. An empty mall provides a number of op- portunities for weirdness; help the players explore them!

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops
   Entering into the ACHE should be fairly easy. The mall area has been emptied and foundations for the dome have started. Getting past the construction work- ers and rental cops should be easy. Once in, they need to find the elevators to the lower floors.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops,
Enemy Drones (Small), IC, Black IC (treat as IC, p. 179, with Biofeedback program)
On the lower floors, UCAS soldiers are extremely
hostile to anyone who isn't expected. Runners should use stealth to avoid setting off alarms. If the runners use stealth, it should be fairly easy to slip into the control room unnoticed. Allow the decker (if the team has one) to describe the scene inside the arcology's host and in- troduce IC for extra challenge.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Soldiers, Enemy Drones (Medium)
   Once the program finishes, an arcology-wide alarm sounds. The UCAS soldiers are on high alert, and guards now block the exits. To add to the confusion, a few hun- dred of Seattle's poorest try to escape from the housing floors when the alarm sounds. On top of that, building systems begin operating in weird and unpredictable ways. By the time they escape, the runners should feel lucky and grateful to be out of the building.

 ONTO THE PATH 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Mentor spirit n. Mysterious spirits that help Awakened individuals find and stay on a particular path. The nature of mentor spirits remain unclear, but whether they are active in an Awakened individual's life or passive, their influence cannot be denied. Also known as totems.

   Note: The mentor spirit Bear is used here, but with minor tweaks, any other mentor spirit/totem can be used. This contract is broken into three parts, with three separate runs.

BEFORE THE PITCH 
The night before the run, the mage/shaman/adept of the group is startled by a deafening roar. As they work to figure out what's going on, they come face-to-face with an impossibly large bear. The runner is unable to move as the gargantuan brown form speaks with an inhuman voice. It says the runner has been chosen to be the rep- resentative of Bear, if they are worthy. Once it finishes speaking, it opens its mouth and swallows the runner whole.
   When the runner awakens for real, it is dawn, and a message on their commlink tells them to meet Mr. John- son with the rest of the group.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Mr. Johnson hires the runners for a simple smash and grab. He represents a local jewelry store that wants its competition crippled. The runners are hired to break into Diamond Lux Jewelry and steal as much as possible. For this simple job, the runners are offered 3 Karma.

OBJECTIVES 
> Smash and grab Diamond Lux Jewelry
> Escape the police
> Grab Bear's amulet


THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops (lots of Rent-a-cops)
   Everything at Diamond Lux Jewelry should go smooth- ly at first. No alarms have sounded and the runners are making good time grabbing jewelry. About halfway into the grab, however, a random Knight Errant patrol spots them and calls for backup. By the time the runners no- tice, Knight Errant cops have them surrounded. The run- ners can fight or not, but at the most desperate moment, the runner who had the vision will have another. Bear appears and offers help if the runner accepts Bear as their mentor. If they accept, Bear will aid the runners, either by creating a diversion, or by having an actual Bear come from nowhere and maul some of the opposition. If Bear is not accepted, he leaves them on their own.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops, Shadow Spirit (use Greater Spirit of Man)
Weeks later, Bear appears to the PC again, asking that
the runner retrieve an ancient amulet uncovered on an archeological dig. It resides in a museum acquisitions department. Security is light, but only if the runners are stealthy. When they arrive where the bear-shaped amu- let is supposed to be, they find it in the possession of a shadowy spirit. They must defeat the spirit to take pos- session of the amulet.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: None
   Sometime later, the player dreams of handing the amulet to Benjamin Grey Fist. Research will show that Grey Fist works as a talismonger downtown. He gladly takes the amulet, thanking the runners genuinely. There will be no reward for this, but sometime in the future, Grey Fist will contact the runners through a fixer and of- fer them a job (possibly any of the Contract Briefs in this chapter). When that run is finished, Bear appears once more to the runner, thanking them for their service.
   From this point on, Bear can be used as a spiritual Mr. Johnson, sending the player and the team on runs that are in Bear's interest, such as preserving nature, protect- ing the weak, or healing the sick.

EPILOGUE
   Bear offers to continue as a mentor for the runner, with all the benefits and challenges that come with such a relationship.

 SNATCH AND GRAB 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
This job's an extraction, plain and simple. Mr. Johnson wants a prominent researcher to be safely taken from the grasping hands of a rival corporation (along with his prototype reflex enhancement research), and is willing to pay the runners good money to get the job done. After the researcher-Jeremiah Singh-is clear of his NeoNET employers, get him to a pre-determined location for the transfer, and payment of 6 Karma will be made in full.

OBJECTIVES 
> Get into the NeoNET facility.
> Gain access to Mr. Singh despite his security team.
> Grab the prototype and get away.



THE SETTING 
This NeoNET facility is a sleek, modern, affair, all angu- lar glass, soft lighting, and off-white hallways. There is a top-notch exercise facility, a perfectly serviceable cafe- teria, and an oppressively overwhelming security pres- ence. With expert technicians and engineers from the Transys Neuronet days, this facility houses high-end cy- berware design and testing equipment-like the expert system that Singh is working on.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Security Guards
   The players will need to infiltrate the facility, first and foremost. They might try to hack themselves fake credentials, call in a favor from an appropriate contact, sneak in at night, pretend to be janitors, or a dozen oth- er plans bubbling up from players' unique minds. Singh should be made available to them with whatever plan they like (he can work as late or as early as needed to make their plan work).

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Security Guards,
led by a Company Man (stats as Shades, p. 120)
   Gaining access to Singh should be difficult, but hard- ly impossible. His executive protection detail is good at their job, but so are your runners. Singh himself is eager to leave, having long since negotiated with Mr. Johnson. He will take cover when the fight starts, unless told to do something else by the team. He is eager to comply and ready to get out of here.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Security Guards
   The difficult part of this last scene is leaving with the prototype: It was just installed into another employee! David Chang is just a bottom-rung worker, and now he is saddled with a cutting-edge reaction enhancement program that a number of people would love to get their hands on. He's a low-wage meat puppet used to test new cyberware. Chang doesn't know anything about any deal, and as far as he knows he's just being kidnapped (and he may very well be, depending on how your team reacts).

AFTERMATH 
   Mr. Johnson is happiest to receive both Singh and the prototype, but he will be grudgingly content with just Singh (his knowledge, and extensive headware comput- er, will be quite a boon). Offer the team roughly two- thirds of their agreed-upon pay (meaning 4 Karma) if Singh makes it out but Chang and the prototype cyber- ware doesn't.

 LET YOUR FLAG FLY 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Unseelie Court: A whisper. A rumor. A hint. Rebellion and revolt. As firmly as the Seelie Court (the mysterious power behind the government of Tír na nÓg, the nation formerly known as Ireland) believes in its right to exist for its own sake, the Unseelie Court, a broken mirror image of the Seelie Court, believes the schemes and machinations of its self-important counter- part must be thwarted. The Unseelie Court is impossible to define because its members are unknown, as are its ul- timate ends, or even if there are any. Those sympathetic to the Unseelie, if you can find them, are convinced these rebels are freedom fighters and seekers of justice.

BACKGROUND
A powerful magical artifact, the Fairy Flag, has been stolen. Unseelie Dan, a Fomorian, is a shadowrunner-turned-dru- id in Scotland. He wants to smuggle the flag to the Unseel- ie Court to support their unseen conflict.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
"Hello, I'm Mr. Johnson. I'd like to hire ye for a retrieval job-six Karma is in it for you if you succeed. An artifact known as the Fairy Flag was taken by from Scotland's Dunvegan Castle by operatives from Tír na nÓg. You must sneak into Tír na nÓg, track down the Flag, and bring it back to me.
   "Getting into the Tír isn't easy, but I can help. Off the coast of Northern Ireland sits a series of basalt columns called the Giant's Causeway. They head toward Scotland, then disappear into the water. There's a counterpart off the Scottish coast.
   "Head to the Isle of Staffa, where the Causeway con- nects to Scotland. A contact of mine, Green Gretchen, has an amulet called Fingal's Ring that can summon a mystical bridge that completes the path to Tír na nÓg."

OBJECTIVES 
> Gain access toTír na nÓg
> Find and retrieve the Fairy Flag

THE SETTING 
Scotland's Staffa Island features breathtaking columns of basalt flanking deep caves, surrounded by beautiful blue sea. In the morning, the sun illuminates the hidden caves, and under moonlight, singing voices often echo from the largest cave.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Tír Republican Corps soldiers (use Soldiers)
   Arriving at the Isle of Staffa (via tour boat or any other way), the runners are met by Green Gretchen. She leads them across the bridge, where they are ambushed by a Tír Republican Corps strike team. In the fight, Gretch- en's hit, and she falls into the sea with the amulet. The bridge's stability is now in question, adding an extra ele- ment of danger to the runners' journey.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Water Spirit, Air Spirit, Bean-Shidhe (use Greater Spirit of Air)
The Causeway sits at the convergence of powerful
ley lines. Strange things happen there, including mana storms and the appearance of strange, otherworldly creatures. Once on the bridge, runners find themselves on the other side far quicker than should be possible. The strange creatures might intercept the runners at any part of their journey. The runners should be able to add descriptions of the creatures and troubles with the bridge to keep the adventure unpredictable.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Tír Path of the Sword Adepts (use Elite Soldiers), Tír Sword Adept (use stats for Rose Red, p. 116)
Once inside the Tír, the runners can track down the
flag by following leads mentioned by Dan. The flag is at a run-down youth hostel in Belfast. They can take it by stealth or by force, and then must head back across the causeway. Once the runners make it to Staffa, the magic bridge fades.

 HONG KONG CANNON 
CONTEXT 
Legendary ork decker William "Bull" MacCallister has a job for the runners, following up on work he did more than two decades ago. It'll take a journey to the wild runner haven of Hong Kong, but isn't globe-trotting ad- venture what shadowrunners dream about?

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
A grizzled ork fixer named William "Bull" MacCallister looks the runners in the eyes.
   "Back in 2056, me and a few notable shadowrun- ners were hired to infiltrate the Ares Hong Kong facility and steal a prototype laser sniping cannon. I normally wouldn't take runs that took so much travel, but I had to pay off an old debt. Unfortunately, because of some embarrassing events, another shadowrunner team end- ed up taking the laser out from underneath us.
    "Now, I'd like you to help me settle this old debt. I want that laser. My Matrix search bots picked up chatter about someone trying to sell a laser that matches the one I want, so I'm sending you to a market outside of Hong Kong, by the walled city of Kowloon."
Bull offers 7 Karma for this job.

OBJECTIVES 
> Find the person selling the laser
> Follow the laser into Kowloon
> Defeat ambush and escape


THE SETTING 
Hong Kong is a powerful port in the political storm of the Sixth World. The Hong Kong Free Enterprise Zone is successful economically, as well as being home to many dangerous monsters, human and otherwise. Spirits and traditions are honored, but breaking the rules can make one rich.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   The runners are treated with suspicion the moment they arrive. The locals don't like outsiders and don't even try to pretend to. If the runners ask around for the laser, or its seller, play up the tension. Everywhere they look, they see people staring at them and whispering in hushed tones. People on the street will give the runners two rumors about the laser. The first is that Gaichu might know about it, though no one seems to want to talk about Gaichu, howev- er. The second is that the laser is being sold just down an ally from where the runners are standing-in the shadow of the wall that contains the Walled City of Kowloon.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   Approaching the alley, the runners are ambushed by members of the Red Dragon Triad. Once they defeat the Red Dragons, they see one of the gang members running away towards Kowloon. If they follow him, it should be a crazy, maze-like chase through Hong Kong streets. Al- low the runners to describe all of the madcap things that might happen when the Hong Kong underworld and Hong Kong streets come between the runners and their payday. If the runners catch the ganger, he won't have the laser, but he will mention the name Gaichu. If they don't catch him, he will escape into the Walled City and the players will have to follow up on Gaichu anyway. Af- ter the runners have dealt with the Red Dragons, people are more willing to trust them and tell them Gaichu can be found inside Kowloon.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, Enemy Mages
   Inside Kowloon is a no-man's land. People are packed in tightly and the squalor immediately assaults the run- ners' senses. After asking around about Gaichu, the run- ners gather that he is some sort of urban legend that the people spread in order to scare gangers away. Ask the runners to describe how they eventually find Gaichu. When they do, they learn he is a ghoul, wearing Red Sa- murai armor, and he is surrounded by Red Dragon thugs. If the runners help Gaichu, he shows himself honor- able and tells them that he does indeed have the laser cannon-a memento of an important time in his devel- opment, but that time is over, and he willingly gifts it to the runners. Once the laser is theirs, the runners must
escape the maze of Kowloon and return to Bull.

 NERPS RUN 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
"That son of a slitch must pay!" Mr. Johnson's all worked up tonight, but that's what happens when you mess with a metahuman's NERPS. A dishonest, hard-working, cor- porate shark can only take so much before they snap, and taking someone's NERPS is a step too far, even in this dangerous, dog eat dog, world. Johnson's corporate rivals sent company men to attack him and took his briefcase with all his NERPS in it. That case has to be recovered, no matter what, and Mr. Johnson will pay 6 Karma to make that happen.

OBJECTIVES 
> Investigate the attack.
> Track down the Company Man responsible.
> Get back the NERPS!


THE SETTING 
The mission kicks off at a Downtown intersection, where the team's client was set-upon while returning home. The trail of clues will lead to an idyllic city park, with well-manicured lawns, stylish pagodas, and a nefarious hand-off about to take place.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Security
   Mr. Johnson's bodyguard/driver was taking him home after a long day of corporate back-stabbing, rat-racing, and merciless jockeying for position (in other words, a Tuesday). As their GridGuide auto-stopped them at a red light, they were attacked by masked robbers (clear- ly wearing similar suits-more corporate security) who killed Mr. Johnson's driver, shot their way into his luxury sedan, pistol whipped him, and took off with his brief- case of NERPS.
   
This first scene should have the players investigat- ing the scene (Knight Errant security will have received special orders to allow the players access, temporarily flagged as Independent Security Assets of Mr. Johnson). They can hack nearby cameras, talk to witnesses, or ask spirits for help, but eventually they should get a clear picture of four Corporate Suits with laser-like focus on the NERPScase and a distinctive black SUV.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Soldiers, Rival Johnson (stats as Ms. Myth,
p. 80, plus a Eurocar Westwind sports coupe and Piloting (Ground) 4), Company Man (stats as Shades, p. 120), Security Mage (stats as Tommy Q, p. 126)
   The players should be able to track the slick, corpo- rate SUV to a Downtown park just in time to see the suit-clad killers handing over their ill-gotten gains to their employer. If Mr. Johnson is informed (kept in the loop via commlink call), he'll be heard smashing things and cursing in the background, out the opposing lead- er as a rival for an upcoming promotion, and demand his NERPS back, pronto. He doesn't want his rival dead, but his security detail are entirely disposable, "Let that tusky bastard slink back into the office with a few bruis- es, though!"
   Rival Mr. Johnson will try to escape with the NERP- Scase as soon as any shooting starts, and this will like- ly turn into some sort of chase scene (either afoot, on wheels, or both). The Corporate Suit and Sec-Mage will, with a group of suit-clad thugs, try to stop the players from catching their lumbering, trollish boss, and if he can make it to his car, the players will have a tougher time of it. Luckily the Westwind has great security fea- tures (the rival Mr. Johnson will be left breathing), and the case is all but indestructible, so even a terrible car wreck won't bust it open or damage the precious cargo nestled within. NERPS survive.

AFTERMATH 
   Mr. Johnson won't care who's been hurt, maimed, or killed, as long as he gets his NERPs back and the rival Mr. Johnson lives to reek of failure in the office tomor- row. His rival's car being smashed up will earn a small bonus, though, as payback for his second-favorite luxury sedan's broken windows and bloodstains.

 DATA/STEEL 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Mr. Johnson needs a rigger for this one and is willing to pay 5 Karma to get the job done. He's after data and prototypes; an experimental drone signal booster is be- ing worked on by an underground drone-racing outfit. A skunkworks of black and gray-market riggers is the target of tonight's job, and getting control of a swarm of light drones is tonight's mission.

OBJECTIVES 
> Break into the facility.
> Get control of the swarm.
> Get the modified data-terminal and the obedient swarm to Mr. Johnson.


THE SETTING 
The underground operation has taken over an abandoned warehouse down by the docks (presenting players with aquatic options if they prefer that). Shadows are long and the alleys between warehouses are narrow, and much of the warehouse floor is dark and cramped with the cast- off machinery the place once housed (in order to make room for the fabrication equipment and networking hardware). Contrast all of this with the burnished steel and lights of the drone swarm for maximum effect.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Ork Gangers (use Gangers, increase Strength by 2)
The first line of defense is getting past the Steel Tusks,
a gearhead gang who've been paid to guard the skunk- works. They're mostly able to just glower and scowl and keep legit street traffic away from the absolutely not-le- git operation going on, but the PCs won't be so obliging.












SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Rigger Alpha (stats as Shades, p. 120), Rigger Bravo (stats as Hardpoint, p. 78, armed with The Drone Swarm), Ork Gangers
   The interior of the converted warehouse is a mon- ster of light and shadow. The darkness of the docks and abandoned building itself is split by the probing lights of a rippling spiral of drones, hundreds of them, acting as one. Bravo is plugged into the customized rig and con- trolling The Swarm, Alpha is monitoring responses and recording everything, and another group of Steel Tusks is split between gawking at the swarm and standing guard.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Rigger Delta (stats as Fusion, p. 96), Ork Gangers (use Gangers, increase Strength by 2), Steel Tusk Lieutenant (stats as Sledge, p. 82, replace Intimidation with Piloting [Ground])
   After securing The Swarm, the runners must protect their Rigger, get the bulky data-terminal/control center (a cobbled-together Frankenstein roughly the size of a mini-fridge) out of the warehouse, and make it to their drop-off point. Opposing them is the last racer in the network, and the members of the Steel Tusks who were out street-racing and only just got the call for help. The chase is on!

AFTERMATH 
   Mr. Johnson will pay handsomely if the customized data-term/control-center is in good shape and the drone swarm is mostly unharmed, but the players may have made enemies in the getaway driver/street-racer circuit.

 PUYALLUP PROBLEMS 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
There's been a mobster Cold War in Puyallup for years, but-like always-it's threatening to heat up. The Ken- ran-Kai Yakuza and the Gianelli Mafia family have start- ed to escalate their long-simmering feud, and Puyallup's locals are hoping outside help can nip it in the bud. The elven private investigator, Jimmy Kincaid, has offered a standing favor to anyone who can figure out what's go- ing on today and smooth all the ruffied feathers. He's working with PI resources, meaning he's offering 4 Kar- ma for the runners' help.

OBJECTIVES 
> Investigate a recent drive-by site, looking for signs of what might happen next.
> Intercept the Blue Dragons go-gang before they wreck a Mafia joint.
> Stop some Gianneli thugs from their drive-by attack, minimizing the damage.
> Find out who's actually responsible for all this, and put a stop to it.


THE SETTING 
Puyallup's had a bad go of it for the last few decades, and the rising tension has even the hard-bitten natives look- ing afraid and restless. The streets should be emptier than normal, in an eerie, "Old West before a shoot-out," sort of way.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
   The first scene is a shot-up sushi joint, indiscrimi- nately blasted by autofire from slow-moving sedans with mirrored windows. Hitting the streets and asking

witnesses what they saw will leave most signs pointing towards the Gianellis, but a few old-timer locals will shake their head in disbelief (and perhaps desperation?) insisting it can't be true.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   The investigation will be interrupted by the howling engines of a gaggle of blue-painted street bikes. Yakuza thugs will posture and brandish katanas and machine pistols, peeling out and roaring down the street with vengeance clearly on their mind. Runners familiar with the neighborhood (or syndicates, or shortcuts, or similar knowledge skills) can guess their destination; Sunny Sal- vo's, Enzo Gianelli's favorite joint! If they hurry they can beat the Yakuza go-gangers-the Blue Dragons-there or disrupt the pack of them en route.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, led by Kim Hyuk (stats as Kix, p. 102)
   As the Blue Dragons are scattered, defeated, or re- routed, the situation immediately escalates again as a group of window-tinted sedans-the model from today's attacks, the same ones often used by the local Mafia- roll up onto the scene with autoguns pointed out the windows.
   In the ensuing fight, the players will quickly spot the crude deception. The Divine Revenge Ring, a Korean syndicate, is behind the attacks in a simple, albeit effec- tive, ploy to hurt their Puyallup rivals. The Divine Re- venge are known to have a deep-seated feud going with Seattle's Yakuza, and-as the violence of the day shows- the situation in Puyallup is serious enough even their ham-fisted trick was enough to almost bring really big guns to bear.

AFTERMATH 
The ruse will end with the Divine Revenge Ring's defeat, but the city's larger conflicts remain in place. The Ken- ran-Kai and the Gianellis will still be glaring at one an- other, and perhaps the best that can be hoped for is that the unsteady peace will be extended a little while longer.

 THE HALLOWEENER  UNDERGROUND
CONTEXT 
For three decades, the Halloweeners gang has plagued downtown Seattle. No matter how often they seem down for good, they always come back. Now, someone has discovered one of the reasons. A long-forgotten tun- nel system, designed as a public transit beneath Bellev- ue and Lake Washington, connects downtown Seattle to the Redmond Barrens. The tunnel terminates in the Barrens just a few miles from the Jackal's Lantern, the Halloweener's official bar, and allows the 'Weeners to es- cape the heat Downtown, regroup, and live to terrorize Seattle another day.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Unfortunately for the Halloweeners, a survey team, hired by Bellevue mayor Jonathan Blake, discovered the Halloweeners' tunnel while scouting the area for a fu- ture Saeder-Krupp facility. The runners are hired by Ab- sinthe, the Halloweeners' second-in-command, to track down the survey team, ensure their silence, and make sure the survey report mentions nothing of the tunnel. Absinthe will pay extra if they are able to alter the report so that Mayor Blake and Saeder-Krupp no longer want to build anywhere close.
   As a street gang Halloweeners are not the richest organization in the world, but their secret is important enough that they will pay runners 5 Karma to help them keep it.

OBJECTIVES 
> Find the survey report
> Stop the information about the Halloweeners' tunnel from
getting out
> Alter the report to make the area appear inhospitable


THE SETTING 
Bellevue is the upscale suburb where the families of wealthy Seattle business people sleep at night. With Downtown on one side and Redmond on the other, it

shines brightly compared to the lawlessness of Red- mond or the excess of Downton. Bellevue does its best to project well-manicured lawns, tidy living rooms, and nuclear families walking pets in the evenings.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Construction Workers (use gangers with no combat skills)
It shouldn't be too hard for the runners to find the
survey team. They still have a temporary office set up at the site. Work is still continuing, but the project lead has vanished. The truth is, the head of the survey team, a dwarf named Mike Samuels, not only discovered the tunnel, but as a result of his investigations he figured out who was using it. Samuels has decided that this is too big to keep to the mayor of Bellevue and is taking the information to the Knight Errant police force.
   His survey crew will gladly sell him out for nuyen or to avoid violence. Let the players have fun describ- ing their interrogations. If pressed, the crew will tell the runners where Samuels' apartment is and where he said he was headed (to the Knight Errant precinct).

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: 405 Hellhounds gangers
(use gangers, add +2 Piloting (Ground) and Street Bikes)
   The pressure is on to find Samuels before he tells the cops what he knows. He won't be at his apartment, but he will be close to a Knight Errant station. Unfortunate- ly for the runners, the route they chose will take them through 405 Hellhounds territory. As the runners exit the 405 freeway, they are accosted by the Hellhounds, demanding tribute or just trying to destroy something, like they do. This could either be a stationary ambush or a vehicular one. Let the players decide and describe how they fight back.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Rent-A-Cops
   Once the Hellhounds are dealt with, the runners reach the Knight Errant Precinct. If they spend any sig- nificant time scouting or doing any legwork, Samuels will have been taken back to see Detective Tonkovich, head of Bellevue's gang unit. Once there, it will be difficult to get to him and depending on how much he's said, the players might need to deal with Tonkovich as well to fin- ish the run. If the players go straight in, without waiting,



HAPPENING WORLD

165




they will find Samuels, with the survey report, waiting to be seen by an officer. If the runners try to use force to get Samuels out, he'll kick, scream and do whatever he can to draw attention to the struggle. If this happens, the runners will have to be creative to finish the job. A brawl in the middle of a Knight Errant police station would be tough. Once the runners get to him, however, they find Samuels to be weak-willed and easy to manipulate.

EPILOGUE
Absinthe doesn't thank the runners, but he does pay them for "taking care" of Samuels. He gives them each a patch, a flaming Jack O' Lantern, and tells them they are welcome on 'Weener turf anytime. Lastly, he tells them if they want more work, they should head to the Jackal's Lantern in Redmond and talk to Carnevil.


































 THE LIGHT WITHIN 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Free Spirit n. A spirit that has been sum- moned to our world, but has been released. This is usu- ally through the death of its master or summoner, and it is liberated to pursue its own ends.

BACKGROUND
The Light Within is a religious group that started in 2068, but it has gained a moderate following in that

short time. It began with only their leader, Warwick Gul- liver, his immediate family, and a small, but loyal num- ber of families. Now, their compound outside the sprawl consists of well over two hundred members.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Your fixer hooks you up with an unusual Mr. John- son-a free fire spirit. The fire spirit forgoes small talk and begins:
   "The Light Within is a religious group that believes that the Great Light Spirit communes with the world's chosen few, by which they mean themselves, and grants


166	HAPPENING WORLD




them prophetic visions and ecstatic worship experienc- es. Recently, their group has been growing exponential- ly larger because their deity, that aforementioned Great Light Spirit, has been appearing physically among them. Here's the thing-the Great Light Spirit is me.
   "It went well for a while, but now there's a problem, and that problem is the leader, Warwick Gulliver. Gul- liver welcomed me at first, but some recent arguments over the vision of the group have made him resent me. I want you to infiltrate the Light Within as religious seekers. Once accepted, work to discredit Gulliver and cement my influence over the group by whatever means necessary. Five Karma is waiting for you if you do this right."

OBJECTIVES 
> Infiltrate the Light Within
> Solidify the fire spirit's power base
> Discredit Warwick Gulliver and escape



THE SETTING 
The Light Within's compound is luxurious. However they got their money, it seems that almost all of it was used to make this place an urban paradise. Rooms for exercise, worship, recreation, and study surround the in- ner courtyard, with living quarters placed along the out- er perimeter. The high walls keep out intruders without diminishing the spectacular view.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: The Light Within members (Use Gangers with no active skills)
Infiltrating the group is not difficult. They are enjoy-
ing the new growth and popularity that has come with the spirit's presence among them. Gulliver will not be particularly suspicious of the runners and will try to make them allies. Allow the players to describe how they do this and encourage them to elaborate. Once they are in his confidence, he will reveal that he knows the spir- it isn't really the Great Light Spirit. Gulliver is trying to show the community that the spirit cannot make accu- rate prophecies by pushing it to prove itself by making

difficult-to-fulfill predictions. It's up to the runners to describe how they make the spirit's prophecies come true ... however unlikely they may appear. After two to three successful "prophecies," move onto Scene 2.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: The Light Within members (Use Gangers with no active skills)
After cementing the spirit's power base in the com-
munity, the runners now have to discredit Gulliver. If they look into his past, they will find that he legally changed his name from Henry Danforth after earning a doctorate in behavioral science. Snooping in Gulliver's office will yield his journals. They outline his plan to cre- ate a new religion using behavioral techniques to ma- nipulate people's perception and emotions, in order to create a sustainable life for himself as a big fish in a small religious pond. If the runners describe finding other dirt on Gulliver, go with that as well! The most recent entries outline his plan to hire a mage to banish the spirit and take his group back.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Great Light Spirit
(use Greater Spirit of Fire), Rival Shadowrunner team (choose one character from pages 74-133 for each runner. One of these should have the Summoning skill)
   Before the runners can act on any of this, a rival runner team forces its way into the Light Within's com- pound. The rival team is there to banish the spirit on Gulliver's behalf, placing leadership of the group back into his hands. If the runners want to get paid, they will have to defeat the opposing team and use what they found in the journal to destroy Gulliver's credibility.

 URBAN BRAWL 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The major league sport, urban brawl, began as a way for street gangs to settle their differences with ritualized, somewhat restrained violence. As a handful of gangs sold out into cutthroat affairs with chapters all over the world-criminal enterprises concerned with profit, rivaling organized crime syndicates-others have back- slid, with smaller outfits concerning themselves with romanticized notions of respect, community protection, and loyalty.
   Urban brawl as ritualized violence, a sort of sports-fueled trial of champions, has had a minor resurgence in recent years among these small-scale gangs. The Alder Street Avengers are one such small gang, with a scheduled brawl-bout against their rivals, Red's Rhymers, for dominance over half a city block. The Rhymers tagged over some Avenger graffiti, and this sort of insult can't stand!
   Unfortunately, half of the Avengers can't stand, ei- ther. A wave of gastrointestinal distress has washed over Alder Street, thanks to Devil Dave's Deviled Devil Rats, a dodgy food truck. Alder Street's honor is on the line, and a team of shadowrunners are their only hope!
   Standard pay for an urban brawl match is 3 Karma, so that's what the runners will get.

OBJECTIVES 
> Move the ball through the abandoned warehouse to score goals against the Rhymers.
> Defend your goal against the Rhymers at all times.
> Maimings, knock-outs, and injuries are fine, but any deaths disqualify the offending team. No killing!
> Get away from the cops!


THE SETTING 
The brawl site is an abandoned prefab housing ware- house/display site, a wide-open space interrupted with

half-finished walls jutting up almost at random, sec- tions of faux-wall for mounting doors and windows, low fences, and an assortment of other neo-construc- tion projects that will provide great cover, cinematic ob- stacles, and plexiglass-protected viewing stands behind each goal.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, led by Red (stats as Strider, p. 122)
   Brawl's on! Teams move the ball downfield with Ath- letics tests (running with the ball, kicking it, throwing it, etc.). After ten hits are scored by various players to represent getting the ball within range, a final Athlet- ics test is made to attempt an actual goal (opposed by a dedicated goalie, rolling Close Combat to block). Regular combat skills (magic included) are fair game to wallop on the other team with, but remember to keep things nonlethal and avoid disqualification.
   Set a target score (at least one point per PC, so every- one has a chance to shine), and the first team to reach it wins the bout.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops, led by a single Elite Soldier
   Knight Errant rolls up just as either team's about to score the winning goal. The real challenge begins as the streets unite to fight against The Man! The battle now isn't just for pride, but freedom, and differences get set aside as the two battered, bruised, teams struggle to fend off the cops and escape. A good showing here will let the PCs win the community's respect (and either overturn a match they were about to lose, or cement a victory they almost lost due to the interruption).

AFTERMATH 
Figuring out how Knight Errant knew about the fight (or why they cared) could be a plot hook that starts a larger storyline. Win or lose, assuming your runners comported themselves well, they'll gain some respect on the streets, favors to call in, and a little money for their troubles.

 UNKNOWN STUNTMAN 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Fall guy n. An actor who performs stunts and takes brutal beatings, which are recorded with sim- sense, and used to make summer blockbuster trideo. Simsense allows consumers see, hear, and feel the ac- tions of the fall guy as if it were them.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
   "I'm your Mr. Johnson, but you probably know me as Colt Majors. I'm a 'fall guy,' currently working on an up- coming Optical Dreams trideo called Dragon Down: Un- sung Heroes of Aztlan. Last week, I was injured on the set, which is common enough, but I believe this time was in- tentional. Two other employees from my company have also sustained injuries on set, and while I can't prove foul play, I'm not going to put them in danger anymore. Instead, I'd like to hire you to be temp fall guys and fulfill my crew's contract. While you are there, investigate and stop whoever is trying to sabotage the show.
   "I can provide you with synthskin face masks to match the appearance of the actors, employee IDs for my company (which is called Unknown Stuntmen), and simsense recorders for your datajacks or trode recorders if you don't have datajacks. I need this straightened out so my company can function without any more injuries, so there's six Karma in it for you if you can help me out."

OBJECTIVES 
> Participate in the film as directed
> Investigate the movie set for clues.
> Stop the behind-the-scenes terror.


THE SETTING 
The set of Optical Dreams' upcoming trideo called Drag- on Down: Unsung Heroes of Aztlan, is created to look like Bogota and the surrounding jungle. Of course, outside of those particular lots, Optical Dreams' movie lot has all of the amenities common to trid studios. The actors, director, catering, costuming, and sound company, along with many others, all have their own custom trailers.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Actors (use Soldiers without the Firearms skill)
   On the set of Dragon Down, the runners meet the director, Heather Banks. She wastes no time in getting the runners in wardrobe. They are playing Aztlan Jaguar Guards, and in this scene, they infiltrate a secret Amazo- nian bunker and are discovered by the enemy. When the scene begins, a fire fight ensues. Banks encourages the runners to make it seem as real as possible, because this is what the fans pay for!
   Unbeknownst to the runners, the Amazonian actors' weapons have been loaded with live ammo. As the shoot- ing begins, have the runners make normal defense rolls, and if they are hit, they take damage as normal. When- ever the first runner takes damage, Banks yells, "CUT!"

SCENE 2:
Suggested NPCs: None
   Banks is convinced that this was just a mistake by the prop department. She of course apologizes profusely but insists that the trid is on a tight schedule, and she doesn't want to waste any more time.
   While on set, the runners will get to know a few no- table people. First, the Star of the show is Monte Zuma, a trid star from the town of Bogota in Aztlan. Second, the company in charge of props is called Leather and Lace Cos- tuming, with ties in Amazonia, the losers in the Amazo- nia/Aztlan war. Last, Phineas Bolton is playing the dragon Sirrurg, the villain of the movie. Bolton is gruff and com- plains often about being overlooked for the starring role.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Mechanical Dragon (use Young Dragon, but remove all Amps and Skills except Close Combat, Elemental Attack, and Natural Weapon)
After numerous scenes of jungle warfare and training
montages, the runners prepare for the final scene. Phin- eas Bolton is fitted into a huge mechanical construct of a dragon, allowing him to operate it as if it were his own body. Some of the runners wait offstage for their cue, while the others (along with computer generated sol- diers) act out Aztlan's final engagement with the dragon. As the runners backstage wait for their cue, a thump- ing noise comes from a dressing room. Inside they find Phineas Bolton, bound, gagged, and definitely not inside the mechanical dragon. On set, the dragon is trying to kill the runners, and he isn't acting. To survive, they need to take down the mechanized monster. Once they do, they find Monte Zuma in the dragon. He defiantly screams that Aztlan killed his family in the war and he was trying to
prevent this movie from making them look like heroes.

IS THAT A BUG
IN YOUR POCKET?
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Bug spirit n. A race of hostile spirits resem- bling giant insects. They come from a distant realm, but desire to break into our world and consume everything. They can appear as bugs or even as metahumans.

BACKGROUND
Early in the 2020s, the sleepy town of Carlinville changed. Population loss caused them to invest in cattle to keep their dairy going. Soon, their cattle began dying of un- known causes, but Ares Macrotechnology saved them (of course, Ares secretly poisoned the cattle in the first place, because that's how the game is played). An Ares rep convinced the town to house a secret facility in ex- change for help with the cows. They agreed, and the cows miraculously began to prosper. They quickly understood that they should steer clear of this new facility, and the runners will learn that this was very wise of them.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
"I'd like to hire you to rescue a kidnapped woman, Nicole Brunson. I'm convinced she's somewhere in the town of Carlinville, just hours outside the Chicago sprawl. Here is her picture. Please bring her back safe."
   Mr. Johnson offers 5 Karma for the safe return of Brunson.

OBJECTIVES 
> Find the underground farm facility
> Rescue (or destroy?) the wasp spirit queen.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Citizen (use Ganger)
   The runners should do some legwork in the town to gain intel, but the townsfolk will be tight lipped. With any amount of force, or interrogating someone away from the others, they will break and tell the runners everything from the background above. If the runners don't ask to see the farm, have a conscience-ridden older person approach them instead.
   They will also give the location of the underground farm. It should be clear that if people in town go missing, that's where they go.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Bug Spirits (Consider altering stats up and down to reflect the fact that bug spirits have merged with different types of animals), Rent-a-cops
   When the runners break into the underground fa- cility, they realize the horror Ares has brought to town. The huge facility holds a genetically modified wasp spirit queen, along with hundreds of animal/bug spirit hybrids. They are all in various stages of experimentation, from being milked to being dissected to being fed to others. This is torturous for the Queen and the hybrids, but they aren't human, so the town tries not to think of it. But they suspect Ares feeds them bug-spirit/cow hybrids.

SCENE 3:
Suggested NPCs: Bug Queen, Bug Spirits
(Hybrids, as above), Corp Security (use Elite Soldier)
   The twist is the wasp spirit queen is the very picture of Nicole Brunson, the woman they've been hired to res- cue. Depending on how they play it, the runners will be up against Ares security, freakish hybrid bug spirits, or both. Allow the team to narrate how they want this to play out-and what they're going to tell Mr. Johnson.



THE SETTING
The sleepy little town of Carlinville is quaint, like some- thing out of a movie from last century. It smells strongly of cows and manure. The runners might notice the folks of Carlinville look a bit sickly. Their skin has a slightly pale greenish shade. Raising cattle, for both milk and slaughter, is the main industry in town.

 ASSASSIN'S GREED 
MS. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The runners are approached by the contract killer Marie Grey, a known underworld figure renowned for her con- sistent kill rate and consummate professionalism. She currently is in a very bad mood, with a bullet in her belly. Scowling at the world from beneath the shadowy hood sewn into her armored long coat, she explains that she's recently completed a mission for a new employer, but now her patron has refused payment and, in fact, tried to kill Grey instead.
   Grey is good at her job, but not cocky; she knows she needs backup! She's willing to give even splits of her promised payment to the team (meaning the team will get 5 Karma), it's the principle of collecting the money (and preserving her rep) that matters now.

OBJECTIVES 
> Escort Grey to her safehouse
> Assault the fortified home while Grey provides fire support.
> Negotiate with Mr. Johnson on Grey's behalf (or just let Grey snipe him).



THE SETTING 
Initially meeting characters at their favorite shad- owrunner bar, Grey hurries the team to a safehouse/ armory she maintains in the seedy side of town (un- fortunately one that the people hunting Grey are watching and ready to ambush). From there they ride to the outskirts of town to the palatial estate of a mid- dle executive.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Soldiers, Grey
(stats as Shades, p. 120, with rifles instead of pistols)
   The team escorts Grey to her safehouse, where she can recover her unhackable, hard-copy files on the Mr. Johnson who hired her, along with some guns. Her ul- tra-secure safe clashes with the squalor of the neigh- borhood, and shortly after she opens it (and allows the

team to arm up, as well, at least within reason), a team of hitmen arrives.
   This gang-riddled neighborhood is basically a free fire zone, and Grey's granting them access to her standing safe full of hardware, so let the players let loose blast- ing away at the black SUVs full of suit-clad thugs as they arrive.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Elite Soldiers, Grey
   After the raucous shoot-out at the not-so-safehouse, there's a stark contrast to the clean and security-pa- trolled streets of Johnson's middle-upper-crust neigh- borhood. If the team doesn't think to take one of Mr. Johnson's security SUVs, Grey can provide them appro- priately stylish transportation (albeit temporarily) to get the whole team to Johnson's home grounds.
   Grey's basic plan-let the team supersede it if they have something cleverer!-is to linger at the rear and use her rifle to clear the way, so that the players get the tension of infiltration, the thrill of assault, or both. She's quite capable at providing fire support from a safe dis- tance, but remember to use her to assist the team, not take the spotlight from them.
   When confronted (lounging by his pool), Mr. John- son won't show any remorse about short-shrifting the killer, nor of his security force's attack on the players. He'll constantly berate and belittle the players as simple thugs who understand nothing but violence, and that the law of the jungle applies to creatures like them. If a player works very hard at talking him down (or black- mail him with Grey's files), he'll transfer over the credits. If not, Grey will be content with Johnson's corpse as a means of repairing her rep.

AFTERMATH 
Whether Johnson transfers the agreed-upon sum or not, Grey will pay up, and if they impressed her the team may gain a contact as well as the agreed-upon sum.

 CLEANING HOUSE 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Ghouls are infected with a special strain of the HMHVV (human/metahuman vampiric virus) that turns them blind, gives them claws and fangs, and forces them to live off raw metahuman flesh. Most fight their disease and try to stay relatively human. Some don't. It looks like a pack of ghouls-once content to feed off a street doctor's waste material-have gone violently crazy.
   Cleaning out a feral ghoul nest is gonna be a real handful, but Mr. Johnson's got 6 Karma that says you'd be willing to do it.

OBJECTIVES 
> Examine the ghoul warren in the sewers beneath "Doc Johnson's" shadow clinic.
> Find out what's made them go feral.
> Handle the problem, one way or another.


THE SETTING 
The sewers below Johnson's clinic are a mess. Drones handle most of the routine maintenance (enterprising deckers or riggers might be able to spy through hacked utility drones). The "warren" of ghouls itself is out of a nightmare; they live in filth and squalor, with some of their number gone mad from the disease and others des- perately clinging to their metahumanity.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPC: Doc Johnson
(stats as Wagon, p. 130, without combat skills)
   Doc Johnson has thrown damaged/spare parts to a nest of ghouls for years, feeding them organs and tissue that can't be re-implanted (the ghouls, in exchange, dis- pose of evidence of his illegal clinic). Lately the ghouls have attacked people, though, and he needs the runners to go put a stop to things.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Feral Ghouls (stats as Gangers with no weapons or armor, just a Physical-damage Unarmed bite attack)
   Feral ghouls will attempt to ambush the group after they've gotten near the sewer coordinates provided by Doc Johnson. Anyone bit by a ghoul (taking physical damage from an Unarmed attack) should feel terrible, feverish, and with their eyesight going blurry (-1 or more to all actions until they get to Johnson's for medi- cal treatment).

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Ghouls (Gangers equipped as normal, but also with a Physical-damage Unarmed bite attack), Ghoul Leader Rebecca (though not a troll, stats as Ms. Myth, add a Physical-damage Unarmed bite attack)
   The camp of the ghouls is very different from the sewers the exiled ferals attacked from. Here there are blankets and sheets hung for privacy, pirated electricity powering small personal electronics for music, cots and sleeping bags, etc. This group lives like refugees, dealing with their disease, while Rebecca leads them and con- stantly contends with "The Hunger" driving so many of them mad.
   The rise in ferals is no one's fault; Doc Johnson hasn't sent tainted meat, nor cut off their food supply. The ghouls have simply needed more meat lately to stay sane, and there has not been enough to go around. Rebecca's community grew too large, too fast, and The Hunger within the Infected has spiked in disturbing ways lately. The next steps are up to the players: Will they try to monitor or control this population, or ensure they get enough metahuman flesh to survive on? Other street doc contacts may be useful, or unsavory criminal types with bodies to dispose of.

AFTERMATH 
Rebecca and her tribe could prove useful allies and infor- mants if they are helped instead of attacked, and if peace is restored (no matter how) Doc Johnson will be good to his word and pay up.

 STREET SWEEPER 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The players get offered their payment from a communi- ty organizer this time, not a shadowy Mr. Johnson but Granny Smith, a sweet old lady that runs a food truck she uses to feed the homeless. As the mouthpiece of the neighborhood's plain-living civilian folk, she's worried about a spike in go-gang violence. What can the players do to sort things out, in exchange for 3 Karma, an awful lot of community goodwill, and maybe a few contacts?

OBJECTIVES 
> Investigate the recent go-gang violence.
> Track down the auto shop headquarters of the culprit.
> Decide whether to put a stop to the Street Sweeper or to help them seek their vengeance.


THE SETTING 
   The run works best near the player characters' home turf, and the high-octane action can work in ne- on-drenched Downtown streets just as well as the pot- hole-strewn streets of the Barrens. Keep the story mov- ing too fast for cops to be an issue and things will work just fine.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   In their initial legwork, the players should get several leads that point them to the Road Dawgz, a classic biker go-gang that favors black leather, burly motorcycles, and shiny chrome. If confronted about the recent violence, they'll raise their hackles and likely brawl, but they will eventually admit to it; they're actually not the culprits, but the victims, of recent attacks.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, led by Mongoose (stats as Kix, p. 102)
Next up the ladder are the Quick Slivers, an up-and-
coming go-gang that favors sleeker, lighter, bikes. Their leader, the razorgirl Mongoose, will rankle at any accusa- tions, but they will grudgingly explain that they haven't been the instigators, either. They've lost a few Slivers to wrecks that they don't think the Dawgz are behind. If the PCs are convincing, she'll offer them a brief vid- eo feed from the latest attack. It's shaky and hurried- the commlink video of someone right before getting rammed off their street bike-but it shows a clearly cus- tomized muscle car, all chromed up, turbo-charged, and with mirror-chromed windshields lending it an eerie, otherworldly, appearance.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: The Street Sweeper (stats as Fusion, p. 96, changing specialization and vehicle to muscle cars)
More legwork and research will lead the PCs to the
Street Sweeper's headquarters, the only shop around ca- pable of customizing a rig like that (not to mention one it's been seen coming and going from by reputable con- tacts). When the players confront the mysterious rider, though, they may be surprised; the Sweeper is a wom- an in her mid-twenties, paralyzed from the waist down, sporting fresh cranial scars and vehicle control-rig im- plants. She and her family were the victims of random go-ganger violence-the 405 Hellhounds attacked them at random on the highway-and now she's made it her life's work to wipe them all out.

AFTERMATH 
How the players react is up to them. Will they stop the Street Sweeper (Louise Prescott), thinking it will re- store some peace to the streets? Will they assist her in her quest for vengeance? Will they try to compromise with her, assisting in more directed attacks at specific gangs? Their choices can lead directly to more work, or can inform who comes after them and who helps them in future jobs.

 TRIAD TAKE-OUT 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Bing-Lei "Billy" Shen is an up-and-coming Red Pole (lieutenant) and hitman in the Octagon Triad. He's got style, panache, elven charm, strong Kung-Fu, adept abil- ities, and-right now-a few bullet holes in him and his tailored suit, with more incoming fire on the way!
   Billy calls mid-chase, needing the players to run in- terference for him and then handle some errands. He needs some get-back against a rival Triad that tried to take him out. The Yellow Lotus are no joke, but Billy's got to handle them without leaning on his Triad for support. He's involved in an internal schism and could lose face if he asks his gang for favors. He needs the runners to scramble and deliver some justice for him; his superiors in the organization will respect his independence and initiative. His hoop's in a sling, and he'll pay 5 Karma to runners who can help him get it out.

OBJECTIVES 
> Help Billy get clear and escape to his safehouse.
> Shoot up the Golden Blossom Wok, a Yellow Lotus-owned restaurant.
> Go after Fat Belly Chang, the Yellow Lotus Red Pole Billy blames for the hit on him.

This mission will tour Downtown neighborhoods dom- inated by Chinese immigrants and the criminal syndi- cates that recruit from and extort them. You can play up the contrast of old-style decorations (fireworks and paper lanterns) contrasted with the high-tech realities of the Sixth World (neon and augmented reality), in the same way there's a sharp contrast between the work-a- day citizens of Chinatown and the flashy, dangerous, mobsters that prey on them.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   First thing's first, the players need to keep Billy Shen from getting finished off. As soon as they intercept the rolling chase/battle, have the bike-riding Triad killers adjust their fire from Billy (who floors it after a grate- ful farewell). Keep the action fast-paced and cinematic, with the Triad killers riding racing bikes and spraying autofire from sleek machine pistols.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   As soon as the action from the chase scene stops, have the players get another commlink call from Billy, grimacing in pain but in a safehouse. He wants the play- ers to bust up a Yellow Lotus restaurant, Golden Blossom Wok, to send a message.
   The fight at the Golden Blossom Wok can go a lot of different ways based on the players' ideas. They can keep it simple and pull an ugly drive-by, they can wade in and bust the place up with bats, or they can just whistle up a spirit and order it to smash the place. Triad thugs on- site will put up a token defense, but they're really not prepared to stop a full-on runner team with their hearts set on property damage.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, Fat Belly Chang (stats as Sledge, p. 82), Seven Thunders Raging (stats as Tommy Q, p. 126)
Finally, Shen will ask the runners to go after the Yel-
low Lotus boss behind the initial attack. Fat Belly Chang is an orkish killer who's gone to seed, plumped up by his success but still a formidable foe. The players can find him at a laundry's back-room gambling den. Chang is surrounded by a complement of suit-clad bodyguards, and also Seven Thunders Raging, a nattily dressed body- guard and combat mage.

AFTERMATH 
Billy Shen will pay the characters the promised price, and if they did a good job they earned something else- his trust. The elf 's a decent guy for a mobster and can be retained as a contact, which might net the runners favor from Shen's Triad or access to some of their supplies.

 TRUCKING WITH THE FAE 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The Deireadh An Tuartheil, a hospital serving the peo- ple of the Tarislar elven ghetto, is in desperate need of supplies. A large delivery has been arranged (including some magical reagents and rare laés-based elven con- coctions), but the cargo and driver have been seized by a branch of the Tír Tairngire government. The driver is one Harrison Stiobhard, a Seelie Court citizen, which has other factions within the Tír government concerned enough to break him out.
   The Information Secretariat-the elven nation's spies and secret police-currently hold Stiobhard and his il- licit cargo. Captain Loriel Taylor, a young combat mage in the Tír Peace Force, is eager to disrupt the rival orga- nization's plans and help the Tarislar hospital all in one fell swoop. She wants outside help, and she's decided it's a job for shadowrunners. An elf-heavy group might be chosen because they'll blend in, a mostly human group could be justified because they're an unknown quantity, and so on-spin it however is needed to make your play- ers sound like a good fit.

OBJECTIVES 
> Travel through Salish territory and across the border with Captain Taylor.
> Free the elven smuggler Harrison Stiobhard and his load of pharmaceuticals and reagents.
> Escort Stiobhard back to Seattle.



THE SETTING 
The drive south through Salish territory is low-tech and rugged, and the countryside of the Tír itself is a forested wonderland, all of which may feel alien and discomfiting to city-born runners used to concrete Sprawl.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCS: Ork Gangers,
Captain Loriel Taylor (stats as Tommy Q, p. 126)
   The young Captain Taylor will drive the players along an open-secret smuggler route. She's a Peace Force offi-

cer, but that won't impress the Salish Orks that run the refueling camps along the way. They'll go easier on a team with lots of orks and trolls in it, but anyone else can expect a resentful shakedown and a brawl. The orks de- mand the group pay the usual cut for the lucrative "Daisy Eater Run" into elven territory, not just gas money.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCS: Elf Soldiers, potentially
led by combat mage (stats as Coydog, p. 74).
   Captain Taylor leads the team around border check- points by taking an overnight trek through the woods. She's a capable forester (anyone paying particular atten- tion or asking her for help can get a +1 to Survival tests for the rest of the adventure), but unless the team takes remarkable steps to avoid detection, they should have a skirmish with the infamous Border Patrol or a band of rogue "Mistish Farad," xenophobic Paladins dedicated to elven supremacy.
   If accosted by uniformed Border Patrol soldiers, Taylor will argue for nonlethal attacks and may even try to or- der the elves to stand down (with one or two calling her "Princess" in the excitement). Against the rogue Follow- ers of the Hunt, though, she will be merciless, and any mention of her noble rank will come from those elves with an accusation of her being a race traitor. If pressed, she will admit to being the daughter of Prince Connal Taylor, but insists she's only a captain while on a mission.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Birdsong (12 Biotech dice), Soldiers
   The team must find transport to Corvallis, the home to the shadowy Information Secretariat. They'll be cross- ing through verdant forest and fertile farmland to reach it (wild blackberries will make a hike tolerable).
   Corvallis is a once-vibrant town turned tense, dom- inated by the oppressive knowledge that anyone, any- where, could be spying for the Info-Sec. A motherly nurse, Birdsong, runs a safehouse here where the run- ners can rest and prepare. If the team is appropriately cautious, they can avoid a fight during this transition. Play up the sense of paranoia, with looming danger con- trasting with the idyllic countryside.

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: Elf Soldiers, led by a Combat Mage (stats as Tommy Q, p. 126), and Info-Sec Hacker (stats as Gentry, p. 76)
The Information Secretariat's paramilitary base han-
dles prisoners and evidence. Taylor's branch of the Peace

Force doesn't see eye to eye with the Information Secre- tariat, nor does her brand of patriotism agree with their methods. She will do what she can to help before parting ways with the team here, but make sure the team keeps the spotlight.
   Whatever your team plans, remember to be a fan of it; they can be as loud or as subtle as your campaign decides, and the NPCs should react accordingly (either with an ac- tion-heavy shoot-out or a tense game of cat-and-mouse as they hack, lie, and sneak their way across the base).
   Harrison Stiobhard is likely not what was expected. Once an elven scout of the Seelie Court, a sister meta- plane to our own, his wanderlust led to him "adven- turing" in the mortal realm, where decades of life as a long-haul trucker have overcome his elven metabo- lism. "Ol' Harris Stubby" always refers to himself in the third person, and he has traded away the glamorous Seelie Court for a UCAS drawl, a mesh ball cap, and morbid obesity that threatens to overwhelm his t-shirt at any moment.
   Stubby's smuggling vessel, "The Orkchop Express" (complete with a fanciful airbrushing job that shows a leaner, meaner, Stiobhard fighting fantastic enemies) is sealed pending investigation not far from his holding cell. Once reunited with his noble steed, Stubby is a sur- prisingly capable driver who will cheerfully rocket the big rig onto the open road.

SCENE 6
Suggested NPCs: Trucks and bikes full of Ork Gangers, led by a tougher foe (stats as Sledge, P. 82), Harris Stubby (10 Piloting dice)
All that's left after the Great Corvallis Breakout is
the ride home. For an easier run, have the team hear

from Captain Taylor that the political infighting within the Tír has cleared the way, as has Harris' status as a citizen of a sovereign fae state (of sorts). For a tougher job, the team hacker or face may be very busy at a few checkpoints in the Tír. The end result should be a tense but safe drive out of the elven nation (either thanks to diplomatic immunity, forged e-papers, or bribes and fast talking).
   None of which will help with the Salish Orks and their banditry on the way back! The open roads aren't safe at the best of times, but this band of orks are no fans of Harris Stubby and the Orkchop Express. Have cine- matically appropriate swarms of orkish raiders attack the one-truck convoy as it moves through the northern mountain passes.
   Stubby can either stick to the wheel when the action starts (if your team would rather fight than drive), or he can slurp a little too much from his oversized styrofoam cup filled with some laés-wine frozen concoction (if a player wants to drive the big rig into combat on the Fa- erie Road!).

AFTERMATH 
With the Salish Orks off their back, the players only have one last threat to face: a long ride with Harris Stubby regaling them with stories of his fae heroics, his wild po- litical ramblings, and his unique perspective about hu- man/metahuman/Seelie relations.
   At the end of the trip, they'll have payment from the good folks of the Tarislar hospital (including discount- ed medical care or access to goods), the vague thanks of some patrons in the Tír, and a favor to call on from an eccentric trucker.

 ONE FOR ALL 
OBJECTIVES 
> Find where the captured team is being held
> Find a way into the holding site
> Rescue the team and retrieve paydata


THE SETTING 
Much of this mission will be taking place inside the Najima Securities building, a fairly nondescript office building in uptown Seattle. The meeting with Mr. John- son takes place in Damian's, an American-style restau- rant in Downtown famous for large portions and over- cooked steaks.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The blond crewcut in front of you calls himself Dancer. He looks every bit the professional, dressed in a present- able suit, but his face bears recent cuts and bruises, and his expression seems guilty.
   "Thanks for coming on such short notice," he says, skipping further pleasantries. "Two nights ago, my team and I broke into a Renraku facility down on the docks. We were tasked with retrieving a set of data files, which our decker managed to do. Almost immediately after that, though, things went pear-shaped in a big way. With the exception of myself, my entire team was captured. I'm not completely sure how I managed to get away. It was ugly."
   He takes a deep breath. "I need to rescue my team, but I don't know where they're being held, and even if I did, I can't do this on my own. I need your help, and I'm willing to pay 5 Karma to get it."

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Dancer (use Reese Frenzy, p. 114)
   Once payment is agreed upon, the clock is ticking. The team needs to find out where the captured runner team is being held. There are a variety of avenues they can take to figure this out. They can hit up their con- tacts and see what's on the grapevine. They could take to the Matrix and hack their way into the Renraku host to find the prisoners. Socially adept characters can try cozying up to Renraku security personnel to sweet- talk the information out of them. They might come up

with ideas of their own. Player creativity should be en- couraged and rewarded.
   While this is going on, they can interact with Dancer, who eventually comes out and admits that he was the one who screwed up and brought security down on his team in the first place. They can also do some legwork to find out his bona fides; successful research tells them that while Dancer is relatively new to the shadows, his reputation is fairly solid.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Corporate Security, Corporate Suit
   Eventually, the runners should discover that the captured team is being held in a sub-basement of the Najima Securities building further uptown. Through sev- eral layers of corporate and legal paperwork, it's easy to determine that Najima is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Renraku Computer Systems. Getting there isn't a prob- lem. It's getting into the secure facility, and then down into the more highly secured sub-basement holding area that present a greater difficulty.
   Again, player creativity is encouraged. The direct ap- proach is contra-indicated, but there are a variety of al- ternatives ranging from impersonating a janitorial crew, to lifting a keycard off one of the guards, to the pure moxie of bluffing their way in.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Dancer's team (use Shades, p. 120, Sledge, p. 82, Coydog, p. 74, and Bit-Bucket, p. 86, but reduce Strength by 1, increase Willpower by 1)
The captured team is in three different places in the
sub-basement. Two of them, a human woman and a male ork, are seated sullenly in a cell. In another cell is a female elf; her hands are bound with special handcuffs that surround and immobilize the entire hand, while her head is completely covered in a tight-fitting leath- er hood, with only her nose exposed to allow breathing. Any magical character, or those with backgrounds and knowledge skills that include law enforcement and/or magical security will recognize them as magecuffs and a magemask. She is also quite unconscious; Renraku secu- rity is taking no chances with a magician attempting to leave their gracious hospitality behind, so they tranqed her to the gills on top of their other precautions.
   The fourth member of the team is in an interrogation room. She's a young dwarf woman, surrounded by a couple of medical types preparing to inject her with something. This is the team's decker, and she has a considerable amount of very important paydata locked carefully in her cybernetic headware implants. Her hosts are sparing no effort to get her to unlock her headware, and she's clearly terrified.
   They've found the team. It's time now for some dar- ing heroics!

 COMPANY TOWN 
BACKGROUND 
Art Vogel, an environmentalist dwarf who owns nearly twenty-five percent of Ares Macrotechnology, spends most of his time on the corp's Daedalus space station. He's recently come back down to Earth, which has led to speculation that he is up to something.

OBJECTIVES 
> Get biometric data from Cross Global Development
> Get employee RFID tag and access code from Gavilan Ventures
> Get ID card and voice recognition sample from Project Avalon



THE SETTING 
Located on the eastern border of Michigan, north of Lake Erie, Detroit is a model of safety and prosperity. Ares might stumble and fall in other places, but in Detroit, they are everything. Even unemployment is under two percent. Oversight by civic and corporate entities merg- es well to govern this hyper-modern city. The eight-me- ter wall around the entire sprawl doesn't hurt, either.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
The private room in the Eye of the Needle restaurant of- fers a spectacular view of the Seattle skyline. A human woman in her mid-thirties, attractive and professionally dressed, is seated at the table, her back to the window. "Thank you for coming this evening," she says once the team is seated. "My employer wants you to access three subsidiaries of Ares Macrotechnology. He needs access code information from employees of these three compa- nies. Subtlety is a must; he wishes to use this informa- tion at a later time, and anything that would cause the companies in question to change the access information would make the mission a waste of time."
   She pauses and takes a drink, then continues. "Trans- portation to and from Detroit will be provided, of course. Your compensation for the job will be 6 Karma."

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cop, Corporate Security, Corporate Suit
   Cross Global Development used to be Cross Applied Technologies, a large and diverse umbrella corporation run by Leonard Aurelius. Currently, it is mostly con- cerned with finance. At Cross Global, biometric scans of both fingerprints and retinas are used to verify employ- ee identification. The runners must somehow acquire samples of these without alerting anyone that there is a problem. Encourage players to come up with creative solutions to getting the ID information.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Corporate Security, Corporate Suit
   Gavilan Ventures is a shell company that is home to twelve percent of Ares' stock. Since its headquarters is in Singapore, Gavilan's Detroit branch serves mostly as a hub for data and human resources. However, there is a large and well-protected server bank in the basement. Those in management are encouraged (read: contracted) to live on site, with their families occupying the upper levels. Man- agers have an RFID tag implanted on-site once they move in, and they are given a memorized access code. Both are needed to grant them access to Gavilan Ventures' offices.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Bug Spirits (at least 2 per runner)
   Project Avalon was scrapped by Ares for reasons un- known. The facility that housed it is abandoned, and no information on anyone who worked on it is available. Talk around Detroit suggests that nothing was ever moved out of there, so there's a chance that employee records might still be on-site. Once they get in, the run- ners must head to the HR office to find employee re- cords. Along the way, they find very curious prototype rifles (one per runner) left over from Project Avalon. Un- fortunately, they also find an infestation of bug spirits. Once the runners have dealt with the bugs, they find re- mains of employees, with both ID cards and commlinks with recorded voice notes.
Prototype weapons use the following stats:

Damage	Close  Near  Far
Project Avalon manatech rifle	12P/AA	OK	OK	-2

   The weapons fire a sickly yellow-green bolt of ener- gy and are only effective against bug (and other) spirits. After the first shot, the weapon grows noticeably, almost uncomfortably, warm; after the second shot, some of the components melt, and the weapon is useless.

 MY FAIR LADY 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Club Penumbra is hopping tonight. The pulse-pounding rhythms of the Fragging Unicorns are threatening to liq- uefy your eardrums when Mr. Johnson invites you into a booth and pulls the curtain. A tall elf with bleach blond hair and two datajacks on his skull makes his offer.
   "Within my flesh, there is a soul that counts thee its creditor, lords and ladies, for meeting me at this late hour. I would procure thy services for an adventure of most won- drous importance. There remains, here in Seattle, a castle of steel and glass that hath used to hold the name Aneki Corporation. It has since become just another Renraku fa- cility. I wilt be making a run into that same castle tonight. Thy job is to hack into yon computer server on the highest floor whereupon thou must download a file called 'Drake.' In order to distract mine enemies, wait inside yonder Ma- trix to be noticed, defeat at least one of the foul intrusion countermeasures, then jack out. Escape the castle, I wilt forward thee payment of 5 Karma, and our business wilt be concluded." You aren't sure why he was talking like that, but your fixer said he was good for the money.

OBJECTIVES 
> Break into the old Aneki Corp building.
> Head to the top floor
> Hack in, download the file, defeat at least one IC.


THE SETTING 
Downtown Seattle, where the old Aneki building is lo- cated, is alive with life, despite the pervasive rain that falls this time of year. The building no longer bears the Aneki logo; the blue, glowing letters high up on the west face instead read: Renraku. The building is U-shaped, with a courtyard full of greenery that contrasts with the ultra-modern transparent aluminum that now covers the entire surface of the building. Inside, there is a ster- ile environment with very few workers, almost as if they are there just to keep up appearances.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops, Enemy Drone (small)
   The building is closed for the night, but there are drones and security guards walking the perimeter. The

runners can go in with guns blazing or try for stealth. These obstacles won't pose much threat, but they will alert the corporate security inside. On the other hand, if they aren't blasting in, they will have to get past the maglocked doors. Allow the runners to be creative here, and reward sound planning.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Corporate Security, Security Spider, Enemy Drones (small and medium)
Inside the building, the runners will not face very
much resistance unless they made lots of noise on Scene 1, or if they happen to come across a patrolling Corporate Security officer. They should be able to enter the elevator (or take the stairs) and arrive at the top floor with no prob- lems. Once they reach the top floor, however, alarms begin sounding and they are in for a fight. Corporate security will come in waves of four, accompanied by two enemy drones each time. There is only one computer on this floor, and it is in the far north office. The decker could hack into the computer system while their team is fighting the corp, or they could shut down the alarms and stop the waves of security from coming before they hack in.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Outside the Matrix: Corporate Security, Security Spider, Enemy Drones (small and medium). Inside the Matrix: Intrusion Countermeasures (IC): See below.
Once the decker jacks into the server, the Matrix
comes alive to them. This Matrix feels different some- how, like watching an old trid of what people thought the future would look like in the 2050s. All around are what looks like medieval Japanese buildings, but they are obvi- ously upgraded with technology from twenty years ago. The intrusion countermeasures look like robot samurai wearing red armor. The file named "Drake" is located in a well surrounded by a pagoda, and is easy enough for the decker to grab. Once they do, however, the samurai come alive and begin to attack. The decker must defeat at least one, but defeating more would surely cement their reputation as a wiz decker! Once jacked out, the runners must escape the Renraku building, one way or another.

OBJECTIVES 
> Survive meeting the Mudplugs
> Survive meeting the Jerk Monkeys
> Choose a side and wipe out the opposition


THE SETTING 
You think the Tacoma Aroma is formidable on the sur- face? Wait until you go underground. The sewers are dark, confining, and rank. Not to mention inhabited by squatters, gangs, and critters both malignant and be- nign. We'll leave out the explosive gases for now.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Benjamin Tucker is not a very big man, but he doesn't appear all that nervous facing a tableful of shadowrun- ners. "My name's Mr. Johnson," he says. "Blah blah blah. Look, I'm going to get down to it. There's a gang problem near my place in Tacoma. Two gangs, the Mudplugs and the Jerk Monkeys, inhabit the sewer system, in sort of their own mini-Underground. They're starting to argue over turf down there, and it's spilling out into the streets and it's threatening local businesses. I need one or the other of them wiped out; I don't care which. One of them needs to survive and stay down there, though; there are other things that live down there, and the gangs keep them in check."

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Gangers (one per runner), rats, and devil rats.
   A little bit of research shows that there are a couple of known entrances into the gang-controlled areas of the Tacoma sewers. It also shows that there's not really a lot known about the gangs. For the runners to decide which gang to back and which to help wipe out, they're going to have to go down and get to know them.
   
Choosing an entrance at random, they go down and encounter a small hunting party from the Mudplugs. This gang is mostly orks, but there are also some humans and dwarfs in their ranks. They're hunting rats and devil rats to fill up the gang's larder, which is growing a little thin. The Mudplugs are not fans of those who dwell on the surface, and are not happy to see the team imping- ing on their turf. With little hesitation, they're ready to rumble with the team.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers, rats, and devil rats. And a couple hellhounds.
After assessing the Mudplugs, it's time to go see about
the opposition. One of the other entrances takes them into a different, but eerily similar, section of the sewer system. The ubiquitous hordes of rats are everywhere.
   Hearing yelping and cursing, the runners follow the noises to find a gnarled-looking dwarf wearing the col- ors of the Jerk Monkeys, training a pair of largish hell- hounds. He's using the expedient, but unpopular, "beat the stuffing out of them with a bat" method of training, and it may or may not be working. He's at least managed to not be roasted alive yet. He takes a certain amount of exception to being interrupted, especially if the run- ners have issues with his training methods. He'll give a sharp whistle, and a few more gangers will start to ap- pear a narration or two after things start heating up. And they'll heat up, literally, since the imperfectly trained hellhounds will also join in the fray. Let them add a note of chaos to the fight.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers. Lots and lots of gangers.
   Now that they've had encounters with both gangs, the team needs to decide on which horse they're go- ing to back. Then they have to go down into the sewers again and convince that gang's leadership that the en- emy of their enemy is their friend. Which, considering how the introductions probably went down, isn't going to be all that easy. Once the leadership is convinced, it's time to marshal the troops-all of them-and go to war with the other side.

 LEAKS AND PLUMBERS, PT. 1 
CONTEXT 
From Cold & Hard entry for Brackhaven, Kenneth: ... while Brackhaven had never exactly been a beloved governor, he had a talent for remaining liked enough to keep being re-elected, and that's all he needed. During his watch he had a serial killer, a copycat of the serial killer, a mass attack on his district attorneys, and more thrown at him, and he listened to the boos hurled at him by angry crowds but still stayed in office. He teetered when the Ork Underground became an official district of the city against his wishes, but he looked like he might retain enough corporate support to stay in place-until the revelations of just how far he went to bury the Un- derground came out. It's not clear what led to the corps removing their backing from him-whether it was dis- gust at his lack of morals, or disappointment that he went all-out and still couldn't bring home a victory-but whatever the cause, the closest allies Brackhaven had throughout his administration withdrew themselves, leaving Brackhaven alone, defenseless, and with no op- tion besides retirement ...


BACKGROUND
Kenneth Brackhaven has resigned, and a forthcoming election will put a new governor into office. The can- didates are numerous and jockeying for power, which makes it a great situation for shadowrunners. Some pol- iticians have considerable warchests, and a portion of that money is going to make its way into the shadows.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Ms. Johnson is a young, earnest staffer working for fre- quent gubernatorial candidate Josephine Dzugashvilli, and she invites the runners to a nondescript diner to make the following pitch:
   "We have a leak in our office. Every argument we test internally is getting out to our opponents, giving them a chance to lay the groundwork for refuting it before we even make it. We want to find the leak, but we also want to find out who's behind it-and put a little hurt on them for the way they've screwed us up. We're going to do some good in this city, but first we're going to have to play a little rough. We're ready for that, and we've got 5 Karma for each of you to make this happen."




HAPPENING WORLD

181




OBJECTIVES 
> Find the source of the leak.
> Discover which candidate the leaker is working for.
> Pull off a political dirty trick against the rival candidate.


THE SETTING 
Dzugashvilli views herself as a woman of the people, so she has set up her campaign headquarters in west- ern Renton, not far from Downtown. It's in a strip mall, in between a discount shoe store and a Stuffer Shack (natch). It's a busy place, with people constantly mak- ing calls, having policy meetings, and checking the latest polling data. The runners will be identified as volunteers, giving them freedom to wander around the headquar- ters. They should occasionally look busy to maintain their cover story.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Campaign workers (use Corporate Suits)
   The latest leak from the campaign involved some information about candidate and director of the Seattle FBI office Katherine Choi, who was alleged to be using many forms of torture, including magically based tor- ture, in her office's interrogations. Before Dzugashvilli could get an attack out, Choi released an ad portray- ing her as someone who would do literally anything to protect the citizens of Seattle, and the populace ate it up. Dzugashvilli's attack was neutered before it was un- leashed. The first step to find out who is behind the leak would be checking in on the team members who were working with the Choi oppo data and see who might have leaked it. Deputy speechwriter Ben Solondz, volun- teer coordinator Maria Castille, and assistant campaign coordinator Beatrice Cornstone are all possible culprits; the runners will have to use their social and networking skills to identify who is the leaker.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Gangers
   Finding the leaker is one thing; finding out what campaign they are working for is another. As it turns out, the obvious suspect, Katherine Choi, has nothing to do with the leaker. Again, the runners will have to rely on

their social and Matrix skills to try to make connections, but they can get a boost when a squad of gangers attacks them in an effort to shut them up. One of the gangers, it turns out, just signed up as a campaign volunteer for Downtown mayor Nikola Taul. It seems in Taul's efforts to build a big-time political machine, she has adopted some questionable means of getting ahead.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: None
   Once Taul has been identified as the source of the spies in Dzugashvilli's office, Dzugashvilli wants revenge. Any con will do, but if the runners are in need of an idea, Dzugashvilli can suggest getting Taul to donate to a fake charity. Taul has a strong relationship with Knight Er- rant, so perhaps getting her to donate to a charity she thinks will support officers wounded in the line of duty but in reality funds a bunraku parlor run by and for Knight Errant officers would do the trick. The runners need to remember that Taul has already responded to their efforts with violence, and may do so again if she catches wind about what they are up to.

 LEAKS AND PLUMBERS, PT. 2 
CONTEXT 
   From Cold & Hard entry for Oaks, Dana: Possibly the last incorruptible thing left in the Sixth World, Dis- trict Attorney Oaks has resisted dozens if not hundreds of attempted bribes, years of pressure from Kenneth Brackhaven before he left office, and an assassination attempt, all the while remaining convinced that her job was to dispense justice in a tough but fair manner. She is steely, determined, and humorless, and she is also tre- mendously good at what she does. If she ran a corpora- tion, it would be on its way to AAA status, but she choos- es to apply herself to government, so she is destined to remain a large, high-integrity fish in a small pond.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
   Mr. Johnson, a well-groomed dwarf, does not imme- diately identify his affiliation; instead, he uses the fol- lowing approach:
   "Believe it or not, a few of us are naïve enough to think that this election is our last, best hope to bring some sort of integrity to the governor's office, and to perhaps make Seattle a more honest city. Scoff if you want, but there is little point to putting a lot of work

in some area if you don't think you can make a dif- ference.
   "What I'm saying is there are people who believe this election should be done right, and we are willing to do a lot to make it work better. If there are people out there who have done illegal things, or know of people who have done illegal things with this election, we might be looking to make examples of them. Unless they help us out.
   "It's time to get on the right side and make this elec- tion work right. Luckily, I'm not asking you to be altru- istic-you'd get 4 Karma out of the deal, while some of your recent exploits might be overlooked by people who would be in a position to make your life more difficult.
   "We want to know what people are planning and use it to our advantage. Go get me some intel I can use.

OBJECTIVES 
> Learn what shenanigans campaigns are planning.
> Determine what to do with information about a planned act
of violence.
> Head off the violence and try to keep the streets of Seattle calm.


THE SETTING 
   While gubernatorial candidate Josephine Dzugashvil- li is based in Renton, the other candidates tend to keep their headquarters Downtown, the better to facilitate meetings with various city powers. Runners will be hop- ping back and forth between these rather simple offices, but eventually they'll have to head to the border of Red- mond and Bellevue to head off a planned act of extreme violence.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Campaign workers (use Corporate Suits)
   This should be a fun spying scene, where the runners use spy gear, social skills, intimidation, and hacking to learn some of the numerous dirty tricks candidates are pulling on each other. From discovering that New Cen- tury Party candidate Alonso Solis is being propped up by the Katherine Choi and Howard Cannon campaigns in

an apparent effort to split the populist vote to learning that the Scholl campaign is manufacturing connections of UCAS Senator Charles Seaver to the mysterious Black Lodge, there should be plenty of dirt to discover. To cap it all off, the runners learn that the Choi campaign is funneling money (very indirectly) to the Humanis Poli- club. And this is not just general support-they are help- ing the club buy arms and recruit members for a major gathering on the border of Redmond and Bellevue in one week. Looks like they have violence on their minds.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Campaign workers and Government bureaucrats (use Corporate Suits)
The runners have found information about one of the
dirtiest of all possible dirty tricks; now they need to fig- ure out what to do about it. They could approach Choi with what they know and either get her to stop the effort or give them a cut of the action; they could approach DA Oaks to help law enforcement crack down on Choi; they could inform her opponents; or one of many other options. This is where they need to figure out what their information can make happen, and how much it might be worth to the right bidder.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Gangers (and plenty of 'em)
   Heading off the planned attack on Redmond won't be easy, because most of the other parties involved seem to want to let it happen. DA Oaks knows she can get sever- al arrests from the attack, and she thinks the chance to clear scum off the street is too valuable to pass up. Choi's people have worked long and hard to plan this riot, and they are not inclined to call it off. Candidates whose con- stituents might be harmed in the planned attack, like Dzugashvilli and Redmond Mayor Sonya Scholl, would love to stop the attack but have little means to do so. The runners will have to act fast-intercepting arms, perhaps confronting Humanis personnel, and trying to keep the planned area of attack free of as many innocent pass- ers-by as possible. It's likely they won't be able to fully stop the attack from happening, which will make them face another question: Intervene in the attack and try to keep the loss of life as low as possible, or stand back and let political nature take its course?

 BENEATH THE SANDS, PT. 1 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Reagent n. A normally mundane item with a high concentration of mana. Reagents take many dif- ferent forms, dictated by the tradition of the user. Exam- ples could be ancient trinkets or pure elements for her- metic mages, or animal bones or rare plants for shamans. Most reagents from any given tradition do not work well for practitioners of other traditions, affording talismon- gers of the Sixth World a measure of job security.

   Spirit whisperer n. A person engaged in the illegal rental of spirits. These individuals summon spirits, bind them, and rent them as slaves for others' use, often for shadowrunning purposes. Spirit whisperers often have a poor reputation in the spirit world and are often in part- nership with disreputable talismongers.

BACKGROUND
The Apep Consortium comprises three companies; Nu- bian Insurance Company (NIC), the United Bank of Pan- ama, and Jomakou Industries. They have been a major player in the hunt for ancient and magical artifacts since the early 2060 and are most successful in the Mediterra- nean, African, and Middle-Eastern regions of the world.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
A local spirit whisperer called Alyosha Duska needs something stolen. One of his spirits tipped him off to a load of magical reagents coming into Seattle's harbor tonight. The runners need to find which crate the re- agents are in, and then bring it back to Duska without bringing any heat down onto him. The proposed pay- ment for the job is 4 Karma.

OBJECTIVES 
> Find the crate with the reagents
> Bring the crate to Alyosha Duska.


THE SETTING 
Even at night, Seattle harbor's Terminal 30 is alive with motion. Every product imaginable eventually finds its way onto a boat bound for the Emerald city. Dock work- ers and ship crews hustle to and from cargo freighters, moving massive shipping containers from boats on the sea to storage facilities on land. The smell of the ocean is commingling with the stench of the Seattle Sprawl.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops, Enemy Drones (Small)
   The runners have arrived at Terminal 30 and have to find out which of the hundreds of possible shipping containers coming in tonight contains the crate Duska paid them to find. The runners need to be a bit sneaky unless they want corporate security making their night miserable. The crate is coming in on a ship called Snake Island Express, carrying goods from Mitsuhama Magical Services, a subsidiary of Mitsuhama Computer Tech- nologies. The crate will be the only content in shipping container MMS204897. How the runners find out which crate that is and where it sits can be determined by the players and gamemaster unspooling the story together.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Corp Security (use Soldier), Enemy Drones (Medium)
Once the crate is secure, they must transfer it some-
how to their employer. Unless the runners take great care to be stealthy, attracting unwanted attention is like- ly. But the runners should be able to make it out of the harbor with little trouble. On the way, however, they are assaulted by a strike team from the Apep Consortium, who want the crate for themselves.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: None
   Once Duska has the crate, he opens it to confirm the goods. There aren't quite as many as he thought, but he concedes that the runners are not to blame for this. Rather, he is curious about another of the crate's contents. An ornamental scarab, gold and turquoise by the look of it, seems to have made its way from ancient Egypt and into this crate. Wanting to study it further, Duska pays the runners and politely shoos them away.

 BENEATH THE SANDS, PT. 2 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Alyosha Duska contacts the runners once again. The scarab in the crate is no ordinary artifact. Duska claims that it is the key to unlocking some sort of treasure horde from ancient Egypt. Duska tells the runners that the Apep Consortium has threatened his life if he doesn't hand it over, so he wants them to take the scarab, get on a plane to Egypt, and meet with Duska's Egyptian guide (Ammon Talib). They will then use the scarab to enter the Pyramid of Dimeh, which until recently was com- pletely buried. They are to secure what treasure they can and escape. Duska promises he can fence the treasure and will give the runners a cut, which should amount to 5 Karma or so.

OBJECTIVES 
> Meet with Duska's Egyptian guide
> Take the scarab to the Pyramid of Dimeh in Egypt.
> Use the scarab to enter the pyramid and take possession of the treasure.

THE SETTING 
Egypt's Dimeh al-Siba is an isolated place, far from mod- ern convenience. Permits are required to even get close. Thankfully, your guide, Mr. Ammon Talib, took care of that. Ancient temples, houses, underground chambers, and walls made of mud bricks show what used to exist here thousands of years ago, before the harsh sands and winds reduced them to ruins. Following a path that had long since been destroyed, the sands have been parted to reveal an enormous pyramid, rivaling the size of any you've seen before. The entrance is guarded.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Rent-a-cops, Enemy Drones (Small)
   The runners and Ammon must somehow deal with the guards or slip past them to enter the Pyramid. In- side, a dark hallway leads into the pyramid's interior and opens up to a large entrance chamber. All around are gargantuan statues of beetles. At a certain point, the runners notice the scarab artifact glowing and pulsing. Ammon seems giddy.

SCENE 2:
Suggested NPCs: Ammon (use Elite Soldier)
   Ammon will point out that there appears to be a hid- den nook below the largest scarab statue, which looks like a housing for the scarab. Upon placing the scarab there, a hidden door opens up, revealing a dark tunnel. If possible, Ammon attempts to open the door, take the scarab, and run into the hallway before the door closes behind him. But he will avoid revealing himself unless he is certain of success.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Hem'netjer Mages (use Enemy Mage), Beetle Spirit Queen (use Bug Queen)
The final hallway leads to what looks like a royal
chamber. The hieroglyphics all around the room are il- luminated by an unearthly glow. They depict a scene of abject horror. Robed priests stand around an altar, strap- ping down some unfortunate ancient woman. Priests with beetle masks gesture toward the altar as magic arcs toward the victim. In the next scene, the victim is trans- formed into the horrifyingly large and twisted form of a queen insect. In the next frame, the priests wail as the queen is buried by some magical force. After the runners have looked around, Ammon will reveal himself to be a servant of the Hem'netjer-mages who serve an ancient beetle spirit. Ammon greedily thanks them for their help. He tells them the scarab needed to be brought here so the queen could awaken once more. The ground shakes beneath their feet as the floor gives way to re- veal a slowly awakening beetle queen. She is powerful, but after sleeping so long, she has not regained her full strength yet. The runners must stop her and Ammon be- fore she fully awakens!

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: Apep Consortium Reps (use Elite Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Medium)
After the battle, the runners find very little of val-
ue in the chamber. The stories of wealth were overrat- ed. When the runners leave, they are confronted by representatives of the Apep Consortium, who, in light of the runner's destroying the beetle spirit threat, offer to pay the runners a fair sum in return for the scarab.

 ARABIAN KNIGHTS, PT. 1 
CONTEXT 
   Arabian Caliphate: Until recently, King Kalim Ibn Saud was the caliph of the Arabian Caliphate. He, along with the tribal leaders of the various emirates, kept a tight rein on the population. The only thing that keeps them from outright war on metahumans and the Awak- ened is the Great Dragon Aden. In 2020, when Iran de- clared war on metahumans, Aden rampaged over Tehran, destroying everything within five miles of the Ayatol- lah's compound, making clear that aggression against metahumans would not be tolerated. Aden's action may have had the appearance of making the Middle East saf- er for metahumans and the Awakened, but in reality, the intolerance remained, simmering just below the surface. New Islamic Jihad: Aden's actions may have made things safer for many, but it did not change many hearts or beliefs in the early years of the Awakening. In the last few decades, however, many minds have been changing. When Ibn Eisa united the Islamic world behind him in the 2060s, he called for jihad against metahumans, the Awakened, and a number of faiths and Middle-Eastern nations. However, when Ibn Eisa was subsequently re- vealed to be a shedim, or shadow demon, many of the devout began to question whether their current leaders were really sent by Allah. While this feeling has not led to revolution, it rekindled calls for reformation, which have been simmering since the 2050s. There are those, however, who continue to see war as the best way to
deliver change.
   IRM: Among the common people, the Islamic Re- naissance Movement has been the most successful in shifting attitudes within the Islamic world, specifically around women, metahumans, and the Awakened. Their work has even yielded some small support within the Islamic Unity Movement. But for many, the progress has been too small and too slow.








MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
A shadowrunner known as Goat Foot has been work- ing for the Islamic Unity Movement for decades. They

push reform in the Islamic world and have succeeded on many fronts. One area they are not succeeding is with- in the leadership of the Arabian Caliphate, which retain prejudice against metahumans and have outlawed mag- ic. Goat Foot has become impressed with the runners' reputations, and she needs out of town assets. Meeting her in Dubai, she makes the following pitch:
   "Just last week, the Caliph, King Kalim Ibn Saud, was found dead in his bedroom. No reports have been released as to the cause of death, but the IRM believe that this event has provided an opportunity to create change within the Arabian Caliphate. Before the tribal representatives vote for a new Caliph, you need to get to at least four of the voting emirates and convince them to vote for Ibrahim Kamel, CEO of Caliphate-based AA holding company Haqibat Alqabida. He is Sunni but is sympathetic to Sufi Islam and the IRM. This will allow a more moderate leader to come to power and change the dynamics in the Middle East.
   "The first emirate you need to convince is Jassim bin Joaan Al Thani, the voting emir of Qatar. Emir Jassim bin Joaan Al Thani is a decent man and loves his wife and two daughters more than anything else. That is why you are going to kidnap them and bring them to us. This might seem unsavory, but I assure you, it is necessary. We will keep them safe and treat them well until the vote is over. It is imperative that you do not harm or treat them poorly in any way. Doing so will negatively affect your pay. Speaking of pay, I am prepared to offer you six Karma for this job."

OBJECTIVES 
> Kidnap Emir Jassim bin Joaan AlThani's family.
> Escape Qatar
> Deliver AlThani's family safe and unharmed to Goat Foot


THE SETTING 
Qatar is a relatively small emirate in the Arabian Caliph- ate. The waters of the Persian Gulf encircle all but its southern border with the Arabian Heartland. The jewel in Qatar's crown is the capital, Doha, with its brilliant sky- line and ultramodern architecture. In the streets, souks, or Arabian markets/bazaars offer street food, along with all manner of art, silk, jewelry, and clothing. Runners take note: Qatar expects women to keep covered to the shoulders and knees, and magic is strictly prohibited.


186	HAPPENING WORLD




THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Emirate Security (use Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Small)
Getting into Qatar is easy. Goat Foot can get the run-
ners a plane or a boat into the emirate. Once there, the runners need to do some legwork and figure out where Emir Jassim bin Joaan Al Thani's family will be. When they are at home, security is overwhelming, and the runners will find it nearly impossible to reach them. However, rumor has it that Al Thani is out of the city, in Northern Qatar, for a few days this week. His wife Geri and his daughters, Gabrielle and Lola, will be visiting Do- ha's Mathaf, the Arab Museum of Modern Art. Allow the runners to formulate any plot they like, and as long as it is remotely plausible, then have some fun pulling it off.
   Note: Given how magic is suppressed, a mage might be able to turn the advantage greatly in the runner's favor. Keep in mind, though, that the penalties will be harsh and swift for anyone caught wielding mana.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Smugglers (use Gangers)
   Once the runners have secured Geri, Gabrielle, and Lola, all hell breaks loose. The city goes into lockdown, and not long after, airports, railways, and harbors halt all travel. The runners must now hide their precious cargo while finding some way out of Qatar and back to Goat Foot in Dubai. If the runners try to remain cautious but seek out help, they will find Doha's underground can provide them with smugglers who can get them out via boat. However, they should always feel that there is a decent chance that they are going to be betrayed, even by the smugglers.
   During this whole scene, Geri, Gabrielle, and Lola should come alive with their own personalities, fears, and irritations, not simply as willing background noise in Jassim bin Joaan's life. Geri might be indignant and entitled, continuing to expound on how "the runners will pay for this!" Gabrielle would hide her fear using sarcasm and defiance. Lola will be worried but will gain boldness when the other two falter.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Smugglers (use Gangers), Enemy Drones (Small)
This scene takes place as the runners arrive at a hid-
den dock in Dubai. The smuggler has put the pieces to-

gether about his cargo and informed associates of his to meet him when he arrives. They plan on taking Geri, Gabrielle, and Lola for their own ends, and so it falls on the runners to defeat them and get them to Goat Foot unharmed.

 ARABIAN KNIGHTS, PT. 2 
CONTEXT 
Word Watch: Djinn \djin\ n. Free Elemental Spirits na- tive to the Metaplanes. Most have kinship to fire or air, although earth and water djinn have been encountered. These free spirits are most often summoned by Islamic mages and bound carefully with licit Qur'anic magic to inanimate objects, as not doing so would invite evil onto the mage, according to Islamic tradition.

   Corporate Court n. A body of arbitration for extra- territorial megacorporations. The Corporate Court (CC) has complete authority over disputes involving the AAA megacorps. Founded in 2023 by seven corporations, it is housed on the Zurich-Orbital space station. Currently the Court has thirteen justices representing ten corpora- tions. The court's members (or "justices") are selected to represent the corporations' interests and ensure equity in judgement.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Goat Foot tells the runners that she has been in contact with an unnamed board member from the AAA corpo- ration Mitsuhama Computer Technologies. Mitsuhama wants another ally on the international Corporate Court, and facilitating the creation of a new AAA corporation would do just that. Given that it would also play against Saeder-Krupp (the current second-largest AAA corpora- tion, behind Mitsuhama), Mitsuhama is willing to help bring Global Sandstorm up to AAA status and sponsor them for entry into the Corporate Court if an opportu- nity arises. Global Sandstorm's board is willing to offer Emir Sulaiman Hamad Al Futtaim of the United Emir- ates the seat on the Court, provided he votes for Ibrahim Kamel as Caliph. Unfortunately, neither Mitsuhama nor Global Sandstorm has been able to contact Al Futtaim, although he clearly still runs the United Emirates. Goat Foot is concerned that his lack of communication and erratic behavior could mean disaster for her long-term plans. She hires the runners to track down Al Futtaim and get to the bottom of his behavior, and if possible, make Global Sandstorm's pitch in person.

THE SETTING 
Abu Dhabi is a world-class city whose luxurious beach- es sit on the Persian Gulf. It has two hundred natural islands and four hundred kilometers of coastline. It's an adventurer's dream with falconry and dune bashing. It's a posh sanctuary of high-rise towers, glittering pal- aces and high-end shopping. And it's a historian's play- ground, with the world's largest mosques, desert camps, and oases. One of the coolest things about this Arabi- an haven is all of the ways available for you to explore all it has to offer-including hot-air balloons across the desert, helicopter excursions, and bus, camel, and boat tours. Whatever you choose to do in Abu Dhabi, rest as- sured that your time there will be filled with adventure and culture.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: None
   The Emir's presidential palace is in the United Emir- ates' capital of Abu Dhabi. The runners should begin by gathering information about where the palace is and how best to break in. As this is happening, via Matrix legwork or hitting the streets, the runners should find out that Al Futtaim isn't in his palace much. In fact, while extraordinarily ambitious, he has become known as a man of the people. The next few days, he will be visiting the fire damage caused by an oil accident in the Motor City district.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Personal Guards (use Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Medium)
Let the runners come up with a plan to get Al Fut-
taim alone. Don't feel obligated to favor one course or another. Let them have fun (and if they spend enough Plot Points, let them pull it off ). Al Futtaim will be heav- ily guarded at all times, so a direct approach might be difficult. A few options might be a) swapping out his limousine driver, b) the decker finding out his itinerary and waiting inside the home of a citizen he will visit, or
c) creating a diversion and grabbing him out from under

his security. Reward the runners' creativity, and become a fan of whatever plan they come up with.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Personal Guard (use Elite Soldiers), Bound Djinn (use Greater Spirit of Air)
This final scene takes place once the runners have
found a way to engage with Emir Al Futtaim away from his security, or perhaps in spite of them. Al Futtaim, even in this extreme circumstance, conducts himself with poise and does not ever appear weak or distressed. He simply introduces himself as Sulaiman Hamad Al Futtaim, Emir of the United Emirates, adding that, "you, my friends, have made a grave mistake." Now, Al Fut- taim unleashes a bound djinn from his ink pen, which immediately attacks the runners. After the djinn's de- feat, Al Futtaim seems like a different person. He rea- sons that the djinn that he held in his ink pen was sup- posed to protect him, but it was not what it seemed to be and instead had been influencing his mind. He is grateful to the runners and pleased to accept the of- fer. Al Futtaim offers them any immediate assistance they need, and releases them without further incident.

 ARABIAN KNIGHTS, PT. 3 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Goat Foot informs the runners of Jaber Al-Mishal Al-Sa- bah, emir of Kuwait. He cares little about anything besides oil revenue. Ruyat Baghdad Oil is the largest Iraq-based oil company, and Al-Sabah wants to know their secrets. The Arabian Caliphate is negotiating with (many say bullying) Iraq to join the Caliphate, and if they do, having insider information ahead of time will allow Al-Sabah to manip- ulate Iraq's oil future in his favor. If the runners can plant the Cl@$$yJinn virus in the Ruyat Baghdad host, Al-Sabah has assured Goat Foot that he will support Ibrahim Kamel for Caliph. Plus, the runners will earn themselves 5 Karma.

OBJECTIVES 
> Break into Ruyat Baghdad Oil
> Install the Cl@$$yJinn virus onto a private host.
> Escape without leaving any loose ends.

THE SETTING 
Baghdad is located on the Tigris River, and at one time was the center of the Muslim world. Baghdad, more


188	HAPPENING WORLD




than almost any other city in the Sixth World, is a city of turbulence. Every decade or so since the early 2000s, Baghdad achieves a measure of peace and vibrant night- life and giant bazaars return, offering cultural gems, unique cuisine, and insights from an illustrious history. However, just when Baghdad gets back on its feet, con- flict always seems to plunge it back into chaos. For the last few years, it has been in a chaotic cycle. Militants and insurgents, along with mistrustful law enforcement and military, roam the streets, making suspicion the or- der of the day. Bombings, unexploded mines, and mar- ketplace violence make Baghdad the number three city on the Corporate Court's international do-not-visit list. Best of luck, chummers.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Government Security (use Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Small), Enemy Drones (Heavy)
As the runners enter the city of Baghdad, they are
hassled every step of the way. All government security is suspicious at borders, airports, and docks. The game- master may want to consider using a Plot Point to have a runner's fake ID flagged at a checkpoint. No matter how careful they are, it seems the government is more suspi- cious. Simply approaching Ruyat Baghdad Oil headquar- ters should feel like a spy movie, in that the building is easy to spot, but it has heavy guards in an office building that takes up four city blocks.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Corporate Security, Enemy Drones (Medium)
Breaking into Ruyat Baghdad Oil should be difficult.
Any scheme the runners try should be met with some kinds of challenges. However, if the runners are dis- creet and ask the shadows, they will find rumors of a sewer line leading from a ravine right up into the bowels of Ruyat Baghdad. It will be heavily armored and difficult to break into, but once in, the opposition will be minimal if they are careful. A connection to Ruyat Baghdad Oil's private host is located on the fifth basement level, two levels above the sewer output. The threat of corporate security is real and should be in the forefront of the runners' minds, but teams going out of their way to keep silent (being creative, succeeding at skill rolls, spending Plot Points) should be able to do so.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Brutal Dogs gangers (Use Gangers)
   Once the Cl@$$yJinn virus is installed in the Ruyat Baghdad private host, the runners should be able to easi- ly slip back out the way they came. The only hitch is that the ravine where the sewers empty out is controlled by a local Baghdad gang known as the Brutal Dogs ("Kallab Wahashia" in Arabic). They will immediately attack the runners at the first sign of their exit. If not dealt with, these gangers might find a way to exploit what they have seen and complicate the runners' requirement of discre- tion. The runners should have no trouble returning to Goat Foot once the run is over.

 ARABIAN KNIGHTS, PT. 4 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Emir Talal bin Ali of Jordan is willing to entertain Ibra- him Kamel as Caliph, as he has a child who is Awakened, but only if they can help him eliminate a New Islamic Jihad cell that continues to target his family for death. They must do this without the Emir's support, as he will deny any involvement with the runners. The Emir be- lieves the delicate peace could be disrupted by the hiring of foreign criminals to attack his rivals. The job is im- portant enough that he offers 7 Karma.

OBJECTIVES 
> Do legwork on the New Islamic Jihad group in Jordan
> Make sure that they are no longer a threat to Emir Talal bin
Ali's family.
> Bring proof to EmirTalal bin Ali.

THE SETTING 
Downtown Amman is a labyrinth of streets and markets, mosques, and coffeehouses, surrounded by hills. An- cient Roman ruins mix with museums, the magisterial Citadel, and modern life in Jordan. The locals often dis- agree about what it means to be Ammani, because there are so many true answers. Poor refugees rub shoulders with wealthy western-educated business folk. Muslims of many variations live as neighbors with Christians, atheists, and Nabatean revivalists. While they may of- ten scoff at each other's ways, a hard-fought balance of peace has been achieved within the city.




HAPPENING WORLD

189




THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: None
   There are very few leads from Goat Foot or Emir bin Ali regarding the whereabouts of the New Islamic Jihad cell in Amman. This means the players must get creative in their search. However they go about their legwork, let them find out that the NIJ cell has been kidnapping awakened children. Ask the runners to describe what additional information they find about the NIJ's disrup- tive activities. Eventually, their investigation will lead to a recently fired member of the Emir's security guard.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: None
   If the runners track down the guard, they will find him at his home in Western Amman. The guard intro- duces himself as Moha. He was recently placed on leave for questioning the ability of the Minister of Security to protect the Emir's family. If the runners explain them- selves or ask for help, Moha will tell them "the Emir's daughter, Nina, has secretly been in Prince Hamza Hos- pital for three days, being treated for an unknown ail- ment. The New Islamic Jihad cell in Amman plans to kid- nap her, and may strike at any time. If you were to guard the Emir's daughter and capture the Jihadists, then they surely will convince the Emir to vote for Ibrahim Kamel as Caliph.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: New Islamic Jihadists (use Soldiers)
   The Prince Hamza Hospital is more guarded than normal. The runners should display some cleverness and creativity in developing a plan to get in. No mat- ter how they eventually proceed, they will enter Nina's room in time to see a group of New Islamic Jihadists gathered around a sick child. After the runners deal with the kidnappers, they should make plans to exit. But se- curity has significantly increased, and the runners now have a child along for the ride. At some point before or after they leave the hospital, the runners should notice (possibly with help of a biometric scan) that the child is not Nina.
   This child, Clara, was planted by the NIJ in Nina's room as a decoy, and has been surgically altered to re- semble the Emir's daughter. She was in the middle of being placed when the runners arrived. Nina has already been kidnapped and taken to the NIJ cell's base of oper- ations. Clara, having not been treated well, is willing to

help the runners. She tells them she can take them to the base, but they must hurry because the operatives are already in the process of moving.

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: New Islamic Jihadists leaders (use Elite Soldiers), Enemy Drones (Small), Enemy Drones (Medium), Enemy Drones (Heavy)
Clara leads the runners to the Eastern district of
Amman, the more traditional and conservative of the two halves of the city. People here will be unlikely to help outsiders. But with Clara's help, they are able to find not only Nina, but almost two dozen other Awak- ened children being held against their will. The cell has been using pharmaceuticals and fear to keep them from using their abilities. Unfortunately, the runners must deal with the NIJ cell as well. When all is said and done, among the combatants, they find that Khalid Munif, the Emir's Minister of Security, was at the head of the cell.

EPILOGUE 
Emir Talal bin Ali of Jordan, grateful to the runners, is true to his word. Goat Foot is also grateful, and she claims that, although the work was often unsavory, the future will be brighter due to the runners actions, which is not something that shadowrunners often hear. Months lat- er, the runners will hear a news trid, informing them that Ibrahim Kamel has succeed King Kalim Ibn Saud as the new ruler of the Arabian Caliphate. Caliph Kamel promises a unified Caliphate, standing strong amid a world that has too long followed the path the West has set for it. Caliph Ibrahim Kamel's first act as ruler was to formalize the joining together of Syria and Iraq within the Arabian Caliphate, which had been slowly making progress since the early 2060s.

 UN-SEELED FATE, PT. 1 
CONTEXT 
   Yellowstone Calamity: Only called so by the preten- tious Seelie Court, which views all foreigners to their realm with disdain. But indeed, the incident in Yel- lowstone has brought more than a few foreigners over. The "calamity" was a minor physical eruption coupled with a more significant explosion of mana on the astral plane, ripping a hole in the veil between our world and the world of the faerie. There may also be some truth to the rumor that the incident in Yellowstone has caused a breach in the mana reserve keeping the Seelie Court in its own, private, metaplane. If this proves correct, "ca- lamity" may prove to be the correct word, both for the Seelie and for magic in the Sixth World.








MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
"Good evening. Thank you for coming all the way to Denver for this meeting. Your team comes highly rec- ommended. My name is Jefferson Tlazopilli, I represent a company known as Snake Mountain. If you accept this job, I would like your team to go north into the Sioux Nation, to the igneous butte known as the Devil's Tow- er. Getting into the Sioux Nation will require some skill, but getting near the Devil's Tower will be much more difficult, as the Lakota keep a close guard on the area. That is why I am hiring deniable assets. Please take this device and place it as close as you can to Devil's Tower. On top of the butte is ideal. The Lakota Warrior Society has orders to shoot on sight, so take caution. Once you have placed the device, turn it on, and the payment of 6 Karma will be automatically deposited to your account.

OBJECTIVES 
> Cross the border into the Sioux Nation
> Sneak or fight onto the Butte of the Devil'sTower
> Activate Mr. Johnson's device





THE SETTING 
   The Sioux Nation was created from what used to be known as Montana and Wyoming, with smaller parts of Idaho, Colorado, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Driving through, the runners experi- ence landscape ranging from mountains in the west to rolling foothills and high plains. Along its roads, most see only endless restored prairie or farmland. Farms are mostly automated, most people live in cities like Chey- enne, and those who wish to live off the land like their ancestors are permitted to do so, which accounts for the runners seeing so few people on the way.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Border Agents (use Rent-a-cops)
   Unless the runners are from the Sioux Nation al- ready, they will find it difficult to cross the border out of Denver. The border is well guarded and monitored close- ly. Players should get creative in finding ways into the Sioux Nation, because there is no time for them to apply for legitimate access. Options for runners include be- ing smuggled in, using forged SINs, Hacking the border guard commlinks, or using negotiation and gifts (read: bribes).

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: None
   Once in Sioux territory, the runners have 1,900 ki- lometers to cross before they reach Devil's Tower. How they do so is up to them. Spirits may be able to carry them, they may have already paid a smuggler to take them (but perhaps the smuggler is caught at a check- point?), or they may purchase or hack/rig/steal trans- portation as soon as they have opportunity. There are plenty of chances for interesting encounters and action along the way; make sure something happens!

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Lakota Warrior Society (use Elite Soldier), Lakota Shamans (use Enemy Mage)
Traveling through the Sioux Nation is occasionally
beautiful, but mostly empty. There are few signs of meta- humanity until the runners get close to city sprawls. Ap- proaching their destination, the runners see Devil's Tow- er rise over what used to be Northeast Wyoming. This site is sacred to the Lakota tribe, and as the runners get closer, they see soldiers from the Lakota Warrior Soci- ety making regular rounds, armed with assault weapons. Awakened runners can tell that there are summoned spirits patrolling as well.

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: Lakota Warrior Society Soldiers (use Elite Soldiers), Lakota Shamans (use Enemy Mage)
Once on the butte called Devil's Tower, the runners
switch on the device. When they do, a visual burst of magic resonates from it. If the runners check to see if they have been paid, the promised nuyen is in their ac- count. However, from the west, a large burst of visible magic hurtles toward them and the device. This is the Yellowstone Anomaly, a quirk in the manasphere caused by the calamity. It envelops the runners, if they are all together, and transports them to the faerie realm (see Un-Seeled Fate, pt. 2). If the runners are not all together on the butte, the GM may allow the anomaly to engulf them as they leave together, or be more creative and have the Lakota soldiers overwhelm them, forcing the runners to use the Anomaly as an escape route.

 UN-SEELED FATE, PT. 2 
MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
In this scene, there is no Mr. Johnson's Pitch. Rather, the runners have been drawn into the Yellowstone Anom- aly and have emerged into the Faerie metaplane. See Re Setting below for more detail of their surroundings. Technology works differently in this metaplane, and the runners will notice many changes to their gear (see sidebar). Karma awards for this adventure are not based on pay from Mr. Johnson, but on how well the runners accomplish the objectives-they should get 1 Karma for each objective they accomplish, 2 for each objective they accomplish with what the gamemaster judges to be a nice amount of style.








OBJECTIVES 
> Survive being attacked by the pukwudgies .
> Make their way towards cottage.
> Listen to Niall O'Connor's offer.

THE SETTING 
The wild lands on the faerie metaplane, often referred to as Brocéliande, are mysterious and untamed. While beautiful, the great forest, rolling hills, glassy lakes, and sprawling thickets are every bit as dangerous as the wild- life that dwells within it. Whispers and strange sounds come from all directions at once, and from one moment to the next, singing and screaming can be heard in the distance, but never with any clarity. The air gives the im- pression of autumn, and a gentle, cool breeze blows in spite of the unmoving clouds.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Pukwudgies (use Spirit of Beasts)
   Have fun with this scene. The runners are completely out of their element and are bound to have a variety of reactions. This forest is the template for every fairy tale forest you heard as a child. Play up the wonder and mys- tery. Let them use their plot points to help you create

the scene, or simply ask them what they see. Once they have had a chance to do some exploring, a group of cute but bitterly powerful creatures known as pukwudgies ambush them.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Pukwudgies (use Spirit of Beasts)
   Runners can see smoke rising up in the distance. "Drones" or other forms of aerial viewing show that the smoke is rising from a cottage not far from where the ambush took place. The cottage is empty, and the runners can rest there. Food is laid out when they ar- rive, wine, bread, and various cheeses. Remark about how hungry, thirsty, and sleepy the runners feel after their ordeal. Keep track of who eats the food or drinks the wine. If they do, they will fall into a deep sleep and awaken to Scene 3. If any runners do not eat or drink, they will be awake when Niall O'Connor knocks on the door. If the runners decide not to investigate the cottage, but go off in their own direction, that's fine! Just modify this scene and the next accordingly, having Niall track them down wherever they end up.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Niall O'Connor (use Enemy Mage, but raise Sorcery to 8, add Intimidation 6, and add any two spells).
When the runners answer the door, elf knocking on
the door introduces himself as Niall O'Connor. He is a tall, handsome elf, whose appearance is rather dashing. He says he is glad to finally meet the runners and he has been looking forward to it for some time. If confused by this, Niall will explain where they are and how time works differently here, although he will dodge any di- rect questions about how he knew they were coming. Niall tells them all, once they are awake, that the food was to prove a point, and that the runners should be careful about what they eat and drink here, and should likely think through any other actions as well. As he ex- plains further, Niall can get them home, but only if they do something for him first. Niall's offer is found in Un- Seeled Fate, Pt. 3.

 UN-SEELED FATE, PT. 3 
CONTEXT 
Seelie Court: In the Shadows between our world and the worlds beyond, the Seelie Court blinks in and out of ex- istence, moving from a hidden location within the elven

nation of Tír na nÓg to the fractured faerie metaplane, and back again. The Seelie Court is more than a collec- tion of fae creatures, and more than a place that can be visited. It is a hierarchy of secrets and power, where ter- rible prices are paid and fortunes are altered by those who play the game well enough.

   Note: The Seelie Court and its intrigue could provide story hooks and background for many adventures be- yond this one. For more information on the Seelie and their Court, see the Court of Shadows sourcebook)

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Niall O'Connor says he can get the runners home, pro- vided they do some work for him. He offers the follow- ing pitch to the runners:
   "The Seelie Court has long existed hidden from your world. And yet it holds great influence over your people that very few grasp. Now, however, the rules are chang- ing. The Seelie Court is no longer so hard to reach, and its influence is teetering on the razor's edge between grow- ing and losing it altogether. Those who can manipulate it now stand to gain much for their cause. I would like you to infiltrate the court. Say nothing of your affiliation with me, but rather listen, learn, impress the courtiers. Do errands, play games, and somehow get yourself invit- ed to the Red Sun Ball a fortnight from today. There will be certain fae there with knowledge I need. Whether by skill, charm, guile, or your own inventive ways, listen for the phrases 'Gwyn,' 'Shadow Realm,' and 'Ebon Queen.' Bring everything you learn to me. I can renumerate you with 6 Karma for your efforts."

OBJECTIVES 
> Go to the Great Hall of the Seelie and infiltrate the Court.
> Find ways to earn invitations to the Red Sun Ball.
> Play the crowd and pay attention for Niall's key phrases.

THE SETTING 
The Great Hall of the Seelie Court: Past the intricately carved marble statues that form the archway into the Seelie Court is the Great Hall. Inside a vast chamber with no visible ceiling encircles one, lonely oak tree. Huge and impossibly high, the branches and leaves create a canopy of autumnal beauty. Below the canopy, yet still high, walls in myriad shades of purple stretch down the height of the Hall. Above the floor is the gallery, where the nobility of the Court and their càraidean (consorts) gather for session. The highest seat is opposite from the



HAPPENING WORLD

193




entryway, and that is where Lady Brane Deigh presides over her Court.
   The Red Sun Ball: Located within the Hall of Night, this event conveys a sense of desperation and dread. The hall is completely black, with six staggered, transpar- ent platforms rising above each other, stairs connecting them. For the Red Sun Ball, the newest and least im- portant attendees find themselves on the top platform looking down. An air spirit with the appearance of a ra- ven-haired elf keeps the drapes fluttering rhythmically. The lamps, which barely illuminate the room, are a deep, crimson red.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Seelie Court Members (use Enemy Mage or any Awakened character from pp. 74-133)
Here, the runners approach and enter the Great
Hall of the Seelie Court. Strangely, even if the runners stand out and look awkward, no one approaches them or even appears to take notice. In order for anything to happen, the runners must either do something to get noticed (leave it to their imaginations) or approach one of the courtiers for conversation. There are infinite ways to navigate this scene. Keep in mind that the Court val- ues rules and decorum above all else. Getting noticed for covering for someone's misstep will likely give open- ings to the runners, while oafish behavior or showing off brazenly will be looked down upon. If the runners need hints, let an NPC mention a few of the activities in the Court's Favor sidebar. Gamemasters should let each of the runners narrate their runner's chance to shine.

This scene may last anywhere from hours to nearly two weeks for the runners.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Seelie Court Members
(use Enemy Mage or any Awakened character from pp. 74-133)
   In this transitional scene, the runners are approached in secret and given invitations to the Red Sun Ball. Al- ternatively, you may have a fewer number of runners invited, but they are allowed to bring guests. GMs may consult Court of Shadows to choose a suitable NPC or may create one based on what the runners did to garner favor in Scene 1. Either way, the courtier hopes they will con- tinue to impress the courtiers at the ball. In the ways of the court, this will reflect well not only on the runners, but the courtier who invited them.

SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Seelie Court Members
(use Enemy Mage or any Awakened character from pp. 74-133)
   At the Red Sun Ball, the runners are escorted to the highest platform within the Hall of Night (see descrip- tion above). Unfortunately for them, the real secrets will likely be discussed where the most honored guests are: on the ground floor. Allow the runners to stretch their social muscles. Deckers can attempt to gain information the same way they always do, via the Network of Keep- ers. If they continue to impress the Seelie, they may be moved to lower platforms. Be creative and allow them narrate the rumors and secrets they hear.
   After they have mingled for half the night at the Red Sun Ball, there will be a moment where, on the fourth plat- form, an immaculately dressed elf, Walks-through-Tall- Grass, will be having a discussion with Plor na mBan, the Woman of Flowers. Walks-through-Tall-Grass is a càraide- an under Lady Thisbe, the Queen in Exile, while Plor na mBan has been a càraidean for innumerable Seelie. Allow the runners to hear whispers from other courtiers about why these two would be talking, and why they would be so far away from the ground floor. This should clue the runners in that there might be something worth hearing. When the runners can hear, Walks-through-Tall- Grass tells Plor na mBan, "Yes. It appears Gwyn is look- ing for her. A former Queen of the Court prevented her escape and quietly made a covenant with a shadow Got. She'll remain in Fauth-Doshgoi. Gwyn will be denied his
Ebon Queen."
   Now the runners have what they need to report back to Niall. Allow them to finish off the Red Sun Ball howev- er they wish, and then proceed to Un-Seeled Fate, pt. 4.

MR. JOHNSON'S PITCH 
Niall congratulates the runners on doing what not many can: successfully navigating the Seelie Court. The next day, Niall informs them the information they gathered requires immediate action. "There is an artifact known as the Ashen Mirror within the Seelie Court. It has been used in times past to spy upon darker realms home to creatures who wish the end of all life. The mirror has switched hands many a time, so where it resides now is a mystery. But I need you to find it and use it. By con- centrating, you will be able to see the Ebon Queen's lo- cation. Leave the mirror, but confirm what you heard about Fauth-Doshgoi and its prisoner. If the Ebon Queen is there, we are most eager to know her fate. This is the last task I will ask of you.

OBJECTIVES 
> Seek out rumors of the Ashen Mirror within the Seelie Court
> Find and use the mirror to view the Ebon Queen
> Give Niall the information gathered and return to Earth.

THE SETTING 
Beyond the Great Hall of the Seelie Court, the very foun- dations and structures on which the Court is built upon shift from day to day. There are those who are compe- tent in navigating the ever-changing labyrinth, but to outsiders, the pathways of the Court will appear without rhyme or reason. And they may be right. However, when the Court, or its Queen, wants you to be somewhere, the way will always be clear. Rooms and hallways within the Court range from vast, sylvan landscapes to indescrib- ably ornate and lavish reception halls. Allow the runners to describe where they find themselves in any given change in location.

THE PLOT 
SCENE 1
Suggested NPCs: Seelie Court Members
(use Enemy Mage or any Awakened character from pp. 74-133)
   Returning to the Seelie Court, the runners find themselves once again in the Great Hall. This time, the Queen is holding her Morning Hearing, where she lis- tens and responds to a limited number of her subjects' complaints and requests. There are always those who get their requests granted, and there are a few who have

been bringing the same request for decades or longer and continue to be rejected. One example is a mush- room-headed Seelie who has been asking for thirty years for help to keep certain leshii from eating his family. The runners interrupt this time at their own peril, but af- terwards, there will be many Seelie to speak with, and some may just be bitter enough to speak honestly. The runners should discreetly begin asking about the Ashen Mirror. Allow the runners to describe who they speak to and what they say. If they come up with a great idea for where the mirror is, go with that! Otherwise, Scene 2 describes a possible location for the mirror.

SCENE 2
Suggested NPCs: Seelie Court Members
(use Enemy Mage or any Awakened character from pp. 74-133)
   A disgruntled courtier tells the runners that he was gardening two moons ago, and he observed Queen Ala- chia's personal guard (but not Alachia herself) move a blurry, long, black mirror from somewhere near Ala- chia's quarters to an unknown room bordering the Geo- cache. If the runners ask, the Geocache is the newest room in the court, and it is vast. It acts like something the mortals call a matrix. In truth, it functions exactly as the Sixth World Matrix, as it was modeled after the 2050s version.



SCENE 3
Suggested NPCs: Geocache Intruder Countermeasures (IC) (p. 179), Black IC (IC with Biofeedback program), Seelie Court
Guards (use Enemy Mage, but add 3 to Close Combat skill, add
Seelie Guard Sword DV 6P, and Armor 12 [Seelie Woven Armor]
   Using the information gained in Scene 2, the run- ners can attempt to find the mirror in the Geocache. Any runners without the Hacking skill will be useless in the Geocache, but a decker will shine. They can use Hacking to find the mirror in the Large Stepped Temple floating in the virtual, geometric world of the Geocache.



HAPPENING WORLD

Once they have located it, those in the Geocache will find themselves attacked by IC. Those standing guard outside will also find themselves under attack by Court guards for trespassing.

SCENE 4
Suggested NPCs: Niall O'Connor
   If the runners steal the mirror, they will be fugitives. If they simply use the mirror to look for the Ebon Queen, they will be forgotten. If a runner looks into the mirror and desires to see the Ebon Queen, have them roll a per- ception test. On 3 or more, they will see a dark-skinned, white-haired elven woman. She appears to be trapped in some sort of dirty, grey crystalline prison. She isn't moving, but her face appears defiant. When focused on the woman, the observer feels defiant and hopeful, in many ways the opposite of the way they feel among oth- er courtiers. After this glimpse, have the runner(s) who looked into the mirror make a Willpower + Body test. With 4 or more successes, they feel ill and depressed af- terwards, but with no other ill effects. With 3 successes, they should feel weak, overwhelmed with sadness about something they cannot place, and take 4 Stun damage. If they get 2 or fewer successes, ask the runner to narrate the moment of their life that caused them the greatest pain and they will be plagued with this in dreams for the next two months, feeling hopeless and afraid, along with taking 8 Stun damage.

FINAL SCENE 
Returning to Niall at the cottage, the runners find him overjoyed at this news. He thanks the runners and of- fers them a special reward in addition to his promise of returning home. The reward is a tarot card, which radi- ates with strong magic. It pictures a mirror in the form of an ouroboros. Outside the mirror, a young girl looks into the mirror and touches the face of what looks to be a humanoid with wings. Niall indicates that this is a priceless gift, but he is sure it belongs with them-at least for now.
   If the runners should wish to remain in the Court, Niall will sponsor their bid for regular admission. If they leave, Niall says they should look up a contact of his, a Scottish Fomorian named Dan. With a spark in his eye, Niall opens the cottage door and escorts the runners out, back into their world.

ANARCHY & FIFTH EDITION


ANARCHY AND SHADOWRUN, 5E
If Shadowrun: Anarchy is your first introduction to role-playing in the Sixth World, or your re-introduc- tion to it after a long absence, there are two pieces of good news: First, this book is all you need for many, many hours of Shadowrun awesomeness. Second, if you want to learn more about the Sixth World and in- troduce more elements to your game, there are many, many books out there. Some of those books are quite stat-heavy, meaning they would take more effort to translate to Anarchy; others are full of plot, setting, and character information, offering plenty of inspiration, story hooks, and campaign ideas for Anarchy players with little effort at converting them. Here is a quick rundown of the types of books you'll find in the Shad- owrun line, the information they provide, and what kind of effort may be needed to bring the content of those books into Anarchy.

Core rulebooks: Each of the major areas of the Shad- owrun setting-magic (Street Grimoire), combat (Run & Gun), the Matrix (Data Trails), augmentations (Chrome Flesh), rigging (Rigger 5.0), and critters (Howling Shadows)-has a core book that focuses on it, and there is also a book full of character options (Run Faster). As core rulebooks, these naturally have lots of rules and stats that may not be of the most in- terest to Anarchy players, but there are still concepts and plot ideas that might be useful. Run Faster in par- ticular might provide a range of character ideas for


players looking to bring the full range of Sixth World personalities into Anarchy.
Plot sourcebooks: Since these are full of plot and set- ting information, they very easily translate over to Anarchy and can provide useful information and plot hooks. Market Panic, for example, provides detailed information on each of the ten AAA megacorpora- tions, as well as background on the Corporate Court and its judges.
Deep Shadows books: These books combine plot and setting information with a focus on a particular type of shadowrun. While they have some gear, spells, or other rules that may need translation to Anarchy, the plot, setting, and tactical information can be very useful. Stolen Souls focuses on extractions, Hard Tar- gets on wetwork, and the forthcoming Cutting Aces looks at con games.
Setting books and boxes: These offer details about a par- ticular place, providing info on getting into and out of those locations, the powers-that-be in the area, the geography, notable spots, important people, and so on. The information about Seattle in this book gives a quick overview of the setting, but the Seattle Sprawl box set offers many more details, along with a wealth of characters and plot hooks to use in your stories.
Campaign Books and Adventures: Both of these types of books can be very useful in helping generate story and campaign ideas for Anarchy sessions. Non-player characters will need some translation to Anarchy, but as we'll discuss below, a quick-and-dirty translation can be done easily. Campaign books like the corpo- rate-focused Bloody Business have a looser structure, enabling gamemasters to combine plot elements as they see fit, while adventures like Serrated Edge or



ANARCHY AND FIFTH EDITION

197




False Flag have a more defined storyline to reduce the amount of planning a GM must do.

So since we mentioned translating characters from
SR5 to Anarchy, let's look at how that's done.


 MOVING FROM	 SR5 TO ANARCHY
There are two basic ways to bring characters-the quick- and-dirty method, and the detailed way. When using an NPC from a Shadowrun book, use the quick-and-dirty method, while the detailed way can be used for bringing a player character over from SR5, or if there is a promi- nent NPC that needs to be fully fleshed out.
   Note that often neither of these full methods need to be used. For quick, on-the-fly rolls, the same Skill + Attribute combos used in Anarchy can be used with SR5 characters. Just do steps 1 and 2 of the quick-and-dirty method, and you'll be able to generate rolls that keep the story moving.
   For times when you need a little more detail, here's how to quickly bring an SR5 character over to Anarchy.

THE QUICK-AND-DIRTY METHOD 
STEP 1: TRANSLATE ATTRIBUTES.
Use the Strength, Agility, Willpower, Logic, Charisma, and Edge of the character.

STEP 2: TRANSLATE SKILLS
Use the skill ranks exactly as presented. If the skill no longer exists in Anarchy, put it in the skill most closely associated with it, likely the skill with the same name as the group into which that skill fits in SR5 (such as making Gymnastics in SR5 into Athletics for Anarchy). If the character has multiple skills that fit into the same Anarchy skill, use the highest rating.

STEP 3: TRANSLATE QUALITIES
Select up to two positive and one negative quality that the character has (note that many NPCs do not have qualities, making this step easy). Eliminate any excess qualities, and do not add any extra if they do not have the full complement. If the quality matches one of the ones listed on p. 204, use that. Otherwise, the default assignment is to make the two positive qualities into +2 dice bonuses for a relevant skill, and the negative quality into a -2 dice penalty to a relevant skill.

STEP 4: NOTE IF THE CHARACTER IS AWAKENED OR EMERGED
Carry that status over.

STEP 5: TRANSLATE WEAPONS
Some weapons can be found on p. 206, listing weapons for this game. If an item is not found there, make the fol- lowing changes: For melee weapons, adjust the Strength part of the damage rating to (Strength / 2). For ranged weapons, generally reduce the damage by 2. Assign range based on the ranges provided for a similar weapon. At this stage, don't worry about weapon modifications; many of those (like recoil compensators) do not have an effect in Anarchy, while others will be handled in step 6.

STEP 6: TRANSLATE AUGMENTATIONS, SPELLS, POWERS, GEAR, AND SO ON INTO SHADOW AMPS
The listings on p. 202 can help make this translation; if an item a character has is found there, simply add the Anarchy equivalent and move on. Remember that characters cannot have more than six Amps, so for some characters, some items/spells/abilities/specialized weapons may need to be dropped. Focus on what is key to the character's archetype, and then reduce redundan- cies (a mage in Anarchy may not need both Manabolt and Powerbolt, for example).
   If an Amp does not exist in the Anarchy Catalog, then powers need to be assigned. For most Amps, the easiest thing to do is assign one, two, or three re-rolls to tests made with a specific skill. Spells may have somewhat different ef- fects, but they can follow the patterns established by exist- ing spells. When in doubt, find something close and copy it.

STEP 7: CALCULATE NEW ESSENCE
The character's Essence should be based on subtraction from their current Shadow Amps, not their Essence in SR5.

STEP 8: COPY CRITICAL GEAR AND CONTACTS
Select the most important pieces of gear and contacts the character has and copy them over. It's best if there are no more than six items between these two catego- ries, but exceptions can be made for particularly ad- vanced or powerful characters.

STEP 9: GENERATE CONDITION MONITORS
The Stun Condition Monitor should be the same as it is in SR5; the Physical Condition Monitor should be [(Strength / 2) + 8].

   The detailed way follows the same basic structure as the quick-and-dirty method while adding some more steps, as well as more detail to some steps.

THE DETAILED WAY 
STEP 1: TRANSLATE ATTRIBUTES
Use the Strength, Agility, Willpower, Logic, Charisma, and Edge of the character. For every two points (round- ed down) that the character's unaugmented Body is higher than Strength, increase the Strength by one. For every two points (rounded down) that unaugmented Reaction is higher than Agility, increase Agility by one. For every two points (rounded down) that the charac- ter's Intuition is higher than Logic, increase the Logic by 1. This means that a character with an Intuition of 5 and a Logic of 2 goes into Anarchy with a Logic of 3. In all cases, Attributes remain capped by racial maximums; any prospective points that would go above that maxi- mum are lost.
   For every two points (rounded down) that Magic is higher than Willpower, Willpower is increased by one. If Willpower hits its racial maximum and there are still points that could be added, add those points on the same two-to-one basis to the magic-based skill of the

player's choice. These points can be divided among mul- tiple skills.
   For every two points (rounded down) that Reso- nance is higher than Logic, Logic is increased by one. If Logic hits its racial maximum and there are still points that could be added, add those points on the same two- to-one basis to the Resonance-based skill of the play- er's choice. These points can be divided among multiple skills.

STEP 2: TRANSLATE SKILLS
Use the skill ranks exactly as presented. If the skill no longer exists in Anarchy, put in the skill most closely as- sociated with it, likely the skill with the same name as the group for the SR5 skill (such as making Gymnastics in SR5 into Athletics for Anarchy). If the character has multiple skills that fit into the same Anarchy skill, use the highest rating initially. Then take the other skills in that group, add them together, and divide by three (rounding down). Add the resulting number to the new skill, remembering to not go above 12.

STEP 3: TRANSLATE QUALITIES
Select up to two positive and one negative quality that



ANARCHY AND FIFTH EDITION

199




the character has (note that many NPCs do not have qualities, making this step easy). Eliminate any excess qualities, and do not add any extra if they do not have the full complement. If the quality matches one of the ones listed on p. 204, use that. Otherwise, the default assignment is to make the two positive qualities into +2 dice bonuses for a relevant skill, and the negative quality into a -2 dice penalty to a relevant skill. If players do not want the default, they can work with their gamemaster to develop an acceptable quality.

STEP 4: NOTE IF THE CHARACTER IS AWAKENED OR EMERGED
Carry that status over.

STEP 5: TRANSLATE WEAPONS
Some weapons can be found on p. 206, listing weapons for this game. If an item is not found there, make the fol- lowing changes: For melee weapons, adjust the Strength part of the damage rating to (Strength / 2). For ranged weapons, generally reduce the damage by 2. Assign range based on a similar weapon. At this stage, don't worry about weapon modifications; many of those (like recoil compensators) do not have an effect in Anarchy, while others will be handled in step 6.

STEP 6: TRANSLATE AUGMENTATIONS, SPELLS, POWERS, GEAR, AND SO ON INTO SHADOW AMPS
The listings on p. 202 can help make this translation; if an item a character has is found there, simply add the Anarchy equivalent and move on. Remember that characters cannot have more than six Amps, so for some characters, some items/spells/abilities may need to be dropped. Focus on what is key to the character's archetype, and then reduce redundancies (a mage in Anarchy may not need both Manabolt and Powerbolt, for example).
   If an Amp does not exist in the Anarchy Catalog, then powers need to be assigned. For most Amps, the easiest thing to do is assign one, two, or three re-rolls to tests made with a specific skill. Spells may have somewhat different effects, but they can follow the patterns estab- lished by existing spells. When in doubt, find something close and copy it.

STEP 7: DEVELOP DISPOSITIONS AND CUES FOR THE CHARACTER
Using your knowledge of the character, write down Dispositions and Cues to help you use the character in gameplay.

STEP 8: CALCULATE NEW ESSENCE
The character's Essence should be based on subtraction from their current Shadow Amps, not their Essence in SR5.

STEP 9: COPY CRITICAL GEAR AND CONTACTS
Select the most important pieces of gear and contacts the character has and copy them over. It's best if there are no more than six items between these two catego- ries, but exceptions can be made for particularly ad- vanced or powerful characters.

STEP 10: GENERATE CONDITION MONITORS
The Stun Condition Monitor should be the same as it is in SR5; the Physical Condition Monitor should be [(Strength / 2) + 8].


MOVING FROM ANARCHY TO SR5
Some players may decide they want to port their Anarchy characters to SR5 in order to use the more detailed rule- set of that game. Note that this is a summary; the Shad- owrun, Fifth Edition core rulebook will be needed to make this process work and help with some of the details. As is the case with the previous processes, this follows a step-by-step process:

STEP 1: TRANSLATE ATTRIBUTES
Use the Strength, Agility, Willpower, Logic, Charisma, and Edge of the character and copy them directly. Make the Body equivalent to Strength, Reaction equivalent to Agility, and Intuition equivalent to Logic. Based on their metatype, characters get the following points they can use to increase attributes on a one-to-one basis.

ATTRIBUTE TABLE
METATYPEPOINTSRESTRICTIONSHuman--Elf1Cannot be spent on Edge, Charisma, or AgilityDwarf2Cannot be spent on Edge or AgilityOrk2Cannot be spent on Edge or AgilityTroll3Cannot be spent on Edge or Agility

200	ANARCHY AND FIFTH EDITION




   Make sure the character also receives the metatype bonuses listed on p. 66, SR5.

STEP 2: TRANSLATE SKILLS
When skills have a direct equivalence, translate ranks over from Anarchy. For skills that are equivalent to groups in SR5 (Athletics, Biotech, Close Combat, Conjur- ing, Electronics, Engineering, Firearms, Sorcery, Stealth, and Tasking), select one skill from that group and receive it at the level of the Anarchy skill. Then select two other skills from the group and receive them at half (rounded down) the level of the Anarchy skill.

STEP 3: ADD KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
Knowledge skills play a stronger role in SR5 than they do in Anarchy, so more of them are needed. Add Intuition
+ Logic and multiply the result by 2; the final product is the number of Knowledge skill points the character has, and they can be spent at a rate of 1 point per 1 lev- el of skill. The player should start by selecting a native language at no point cost, then they should assign some points to the Knowledge skill the character already has. They may then add more Knowledge skills to help them spend their points.

STEP 4: TRANSLATE QUALITIES
Anarchy qualities will generally have same-named equiv- alents in SR5. Simply give the character that quality. When a quality has multiple levels (such as High Pain Tolerance or Insomnia), select the quality at the lowest level.

STEP 5: NOTE IF THE CHARACTER IS AWAKENED OR EMERGED AND CARRY THAT STATUS OVER
Give Awakened characters a Magic rating equal to their [(Sorcery + Willpower) / 2], rounded up. Give Emerged characters a Resonance rating equal to their [(Tasking + Logic) / 2], rounded up.

STEP 6: TRANSLATE WEAPONS
The equivalent weapon to Anarchy weapons exist in SR5, so characters should receive those weapons in their standard versions, with no additional modifications.

STEP 7: TRANSLATE SHADOW AMPS INTO AUGMENTATIONS, SPELLS, POWERS, SPECIALIZED GEAR
As with weapons, Shadow Amps exist in some form in the game, so players should simply receive those items/ spells/power/whatever. Many augmentations with mul-

tiple levels, such has wired reflexes, have that level not- ed in the Amp's name (e.g., wired reflexes 2), so they would receive the augmentation at that level.
   Any characters with a cyberdeck should select three programs if they do not currently have three. Any tech- nomancers should select three complex forms. Spellcast- ers should have at least four spells, and adepts should ensure they have adept powers whose power points add up to their newly calculated Magic rating.

STEP 8: CALCULATE NEW ESSENCE
   The character's Essence should be based on their new augmentations, not their Anarchy Essence. If, somehow, this newly calculated Essence goes below zero, give the character just enough alphaware or betaware to keep them from becoming a cyberzombie.

STEP 9: COPY CRITICAL GEAR AND CONTACTS
   Gear and contacts should be ported over wholesale, and players should look at the rules effects of their gear. The player should multiply their Charisma by 3 and as- sign that many points in Connection and Loyalty ratings to their various contacts.

STEP 10: GENERATE CONDITION MONITORS
The Stun Condition Monitor should be the same as it is in Anarchy; the Physical Condition Monitor should be [(Body / 2) + 8].

STEP 11: FINAL CUSTOMIZATION
The character receives 15 Karma and 10,000 nuyen for fi- nal touches, generally following the Spending Your Left- over Karma rules on p. 98, SR5. Karma can be translated into nuyen at the customary rate of 2,000 nuyen for 1 Karma. There is no limit on how much of this Karma may be translated to nuyen. No more than 5,000 nuyen from this process can be brought into the actual game.

STEP 12: CALCULATE LIMITS
Limits in SR5 should be calculated as normal:

   Mental = [(Logic x 2) + Intuition + Willpower] / 3 (round up)

   Physical = [(Strength x 2) + Body + Reaction] / 3 (round up)

   Social = [(Charisma x 2) + Willpower + Essence] / 3 (round up)

Shadowrun's Sixth World is out there, waiting to be explored! From the de- tailed portrait of Seattle in Seattle Sprawl to the in-depth megacorporate profiles of Market Panic to the Seelie Court intrigue of Court of Shadows and more, a wealth of stories, plot hooks,
setting information, and char- acters is waiting for you to discover and throw into your Anarchy games. Find out just how expansive and exciting one of the most enduring role-playing settings of all time can be!


  SHADOWRUN. The Sixth World. Orks in pinstripe suits with uzis; mohawked dwarves jacked into vehicles racing through megasprawls at breakneck speed; humans casting fireballs at corporate-trained paracritters; elves hacking the Matrix for a datasteal of the latest tech or working to topple an upstart corp. It's where man meets magic and machine.
  Dive into a cyberpunk dystopia and become a shadowrunner, a deniable asset who does the jobs no one else can-or will-do. It's not an easy life, but it beats selling your soul to the megacorps. You'll break into top-secret labs, stand up to gangs bent on destruction and chaos, encounter dark spirits hiding even darker secrets, and come face to face with some of the infinite dangers the Sixth World can throw at you. And you'll come out on top-because if you don't, you don't get paid.
  Shadowrun: Anarchy is a new way to get into the best cyberpunk/urban fantasy action around. Based upon the rules-light and easy-to-learn Cue System, Shadowrun: Anarchy is a narrative-focused game experience that has everything you need to quickly grab some gear, load up on spells, and get to throwing the dice. With loads of characters and missions, the book makes it simple to get up and running. Immerse yourselves in the Sixth World!
