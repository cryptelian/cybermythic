### Accessibility guidelines

- Focus visibility: interactive controls must show a focus ring. Token: `--focus-ring-color`, `--focus-ring-width`.
- Reduced motion: respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Transitions/animations shorten.
- High contrast mode: add `.a11y-contrast` wrapper for strong contrast during testing and screenshots.

How to test
- Visual tests: `npm run test:visual` includes a11y spec and baseline screenshots.
- Manual: Use your OS to enable reduced motion; verify minimal animations.
- Contrast: Wrap sections under `.a11y-contrast` to validate legibility.
